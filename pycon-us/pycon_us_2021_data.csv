But creating a programmatic interface to a workflow system is a delicate balancing act: we want the API to be flexible enough to support useful work, but also constrained enough that tasks run cooperatively within the larger system.

We faced this challenge when designing the task API for the Pants build system. We needed to allow custom task code to enjoy the benefits of complex features like caching, concurrency and remote execution, without every task author having to reason about them.

In this talk we'll show how we found the right balance through unconventional use of Python's type annotations, coroutines, and dataclasses. Combining these seemingly disparate features in the context of a workflow engine allows you to build elegant extensibility APIs with just the right amount of flexibility.

In this talk I will cover the main topics we discussed during our meetings, which were all the things I wish I had known when I was first starting to code.
- Programming is not memorization. It is problem solving.
- Don’t jump straight into coding, use lots of scratch paper and pseudo code to understand your problem and design your solution.
- Make sure your code does what it’s supposed to do. Test it.
- Getting stuck and making mistakes is normal. Debugging is not a sign of failure.
- Don’t learn isolated. Find a mentor and join a community.

El tracing distribuido nos permite monitorear sistemas distribuidos recolectando información de monitoreo que es generada por los diferentes componentes. Para generar esta información, los desarrolladores instrumentan las aplicaciones y librerías introduciendo pequeñas porciones de código que envían información a un sistema colector que analiza y ensambla todos los datos para dar una visión general de las interacciones de los diferentes componentes del sistema.

OpenTelemetry también provee un mecanismo de instrumentación automática que permite generar información de tracing en aplicaciones que no incluyen soporte para OpenTelemetry. Este mecanismo se basa en el hecho que la mayoría de aplicaciones usan un conjunto de librerías estándar que está instrumentado con OpenTelemetry.

Esta charla explica el concepto de tracing distribuido, brinda una visión general de OpenTelemetry, presenta una demostración de una aplicación simple y como el sistema de instrumentación automática puede ser usado en aplicaciones que no tienen soporte nativo para OpenTelemetry.

In a way that's true: Python is easy to learn because its high level of abstraction allows you to focus on the business logic of what you're trying to do instead of the lower-level implementation details.

At the same time, Python's abstraction isn't magical: Its versatile data model allows you to hook into almost every part of the language to implement objects that behave just as Python's built-in objects do, enabling you to create similarly high-leveled interfaces for your own objects. That's where ""hard to master"" comes in: There is so much to learn that you're never done learning.

In this talk, I want to entice you to look beyond Python's high-level interface into the wonderful landscape of its data model. I'll do that by explaining one of Python's most ""magical"" features: The automatic insertion of self into methods. Often, to beginners, the insertion of the instance as the first argument to methods is explained as something that Python just does for you: ""Don't worry about it, it just happens!"". More intermediate Python programmers typically get so used to self that they hardly notice it anymore in their function signatures, let alone wonder about what's powering it.

To explain this bit of Python magic, I’ll give you an informal introduction to something called descriptors. To be sure, this talk isn’t going to be an in-depth discussion of the finer details of the descriptor protocol. Rather, it’s aimed at advanced beginners and intermediate Python developers who are eager to get an idea of what lies beneath the surface of Python. With this talk, I hope to pique your curiosity about the more advanced features of the Python programming language and hopefully give you a glimpse of all the things that are possible.

Predictions increasingly drive our everyday lives, embedded into more of our everyday applications. To support this creative surge, development teams are evolving, integrating novel open source software and state-of-the-art GPU hardware, and bringing on essential new teammates like data ethicists and machine learning engineers. Software teams are also now challenged to build and maintain codebases that are intentionally not fully deterministic.

This nondeterminism can manifest in a number of surprising and oftentimes very stressful ways! Successive runs of model training may produce slight but meaningful variations. Data wrangling pipelines turn out to be extremely sensitive to the order in which transformations are applied, and require thoughtful orchestration to avoid leakage. Model hyperparameters that can be tuned independently may have mutually exclusive conditions. Models can also degrade over time, producing increasingly unreliable predictions. Moreover, open source libraries are living, dynamic things; the latest release of your team's favorite library might cause your code to suddenly behave in unexpected ways.

Put simply, as ML becomes more of an expectation than an exception in our industry, testing has never been more important! Fortunately, we are lucky to have a rich open source ecosystem to support us in our journey to build the next generation of apps in a safe, stable way. In this talk we'll share some hard-won lessons, favorite open source packages, and reusable techniques for testing ML software components.

In this talk we’ll explore some of the changes we’ve made to the CPython runtime to improve the performance of our workload. We’ll start with a high level overview of our architecture which isn’t atypical for a Python web application and see opportunities and challenges that has provided for optimization. Then we’ll go deep down the rabbit hole and look at common hot spots in the Python runtime and the results we’ve had in reducing the overhead of them.

Along the way we’ll look at both targeted optimization opportunities and classic techniques such as inline caching, a JIT compiler, and leveraging type annotations for performance. We’ll cover techniques that we’ve proven successful, and ones that are still experimental. We’ll see how these can be applied to the Python runtime and what are the performance results of doing so: overall we’ve seen a 20-30% improvement in our production workload and up to 7x improvement on benchmarks.

Let's get unstuck, with dask-sql!

PyData tooling and Dask are immensely popular in data pipelines, but the beginning stages of those pipelines -- often involving SQL data extraction from enterprise datalakes -- have traditionally required Java/JVM-based tools, such as Apache Spark.

That changed in the past year, with the release of dask-sql. Dask-sql empowers Pythonistas with little or no knowledge of the JVM/Hadoop world to create end-to-end data projects.

In this talk, we'll explore how we can use Python and dask-sql to perform SQL data/feature extraction from datalakes and Hive tables. We'll see how we can immediately refine and use that data for machine learning, analytics, or transformation workloads with our favorite PyData tools.

However, can we also assimilate and integrate it into Python? This talk tries to give an answer and discusses the rationale and ideas behind the recent ""pattern matching"" PEPs.

Processing structured data has sparked ever more powerful programming tools. Python's objects and classes, for instance, have proven themselves to be particularly versatile and form part of the backbone of the language. Constructing or building new objects---including built-ins such as lists, tuples or dictionaries---abounds in any Python code. In contrast, testing the structure of data and extracting specific elements is often rather cumbersome, requiring the frequent use of built-in functions like isinstance, len and getattr.

Pattern matching addresses this issue by introducing a new paradigm to de-construct data, complementing existing tools. It can be thought of as an extension of Python's iterable unpacking to arbitrary objects. However, it does so in a 'safe' way, ensuring that objects have the necessary structure to proceed with unpacking elements and attributes.

The objective of this talk is to give you an overview of why pattern matching matters and what it really is. You will gain a deeper understanding of the core concepts that make up pattern matching, as well as the design decisions and ideas behind the recent ""pattern matching"" PEPs. However, this talk will not provide an introduction on how to use pattern matching in your code, nor is it about the intricacies of the implementation.

But then we'll dig deeper, looking at how you can filter and redirect warnings, telling Python which types of warnings you want to see, and which you want to hide. We'll also see how you can get truly fancy, turning some warnings into (potentially fatal) exceptions and handling certain types with custom callback functions.

It is used by data scientists and data engineers to preserve the integrity of existing workflows, especially as they get modified. As an example, extreme machine learning predictions can be stopped from being displayed to application users if a new model is bad. Missing data can be flagged if it has the potential to break downstream operations.

As data volume continues to increase, we will examine how data validation differs between a single-machine setting and a distributed computing setting. We will show what validations become more computationally expensive in Spark and Dask. For large scale data, there is sometimes also a need to apply different validations on different partitions of data. This is currently not feasible with any single library. In this talk, we will show how we can achieve this by combining the strengths of different frameworks.

To demonstrate the data validation journey, we'll go over a fictitious case study. The data will start small, and we'll apply Pandas-based validations with Pandera and Great Expectations while discussing the pros and cons of each. As data size increases, we'll go over in detail the pain points of transitioning to a distributed setting. We'll show one way to reuse the same Pandas-based validations on Spark and Dask by wrapping them with Fugue.

The typing.Protocol special class lets you define types in terms of the interface implemented by objects, regardless of type hierarchies, in the spirit of duck typing--but in a way that can be verified by static type checkers and IDEs.

Without typing.Protocol, it was impossible to correctly annotate many APIs considered Pythonic, including many functions in the standard library itself. In this talk you will learn the concepts and benefits of static duck typing, through actual examples of increasing complexity taken from type hints of standard library functions in the official typeshed project.

But what does that mean to you? More efficient use of compute resources? Simpler program structure and avoiding callbacks? It should mean even more. Cooperative multitasking opens new doors for inspecting the state of a program at runtime, which has valuable development uses.

This talk covers how Python's async is useful for ""development views""-- visualizing and interacting with the state of your running app-- and gives some working examples that run concurrently and don't require intrusive changes to program structure:

remote REPL - open one or more interpreter sessions over HTTP to
inspect and modify internal state of your app while it's running
graphical visualizations - view custom graphical representations of
state remotely from a web browser. These are written alongside the
code being visualized, and have zero overhead when not observed.
Keyboard and mouse input is possible too.
What kind of visualizations? For a Python app embedded in a home robot, these might include a local map of obstacles; display of orientation, speed, power usage; low res. camera or depth camera feeds; representations of internal state machines deciding behavior; etc.

Quantum computers aren’t what-ifs anymore — they are available now, and publicly accessible over the internet. And Python is rapidly becoming the language of choice for accessing and programming quantum computers, with Python SDKs available from Google (Cirq), IBM (Qiskit), and others. However, early quantum computers are small, noisy, and error prone. Simultaneously, it has never been easier to perform differentiable programming in Python; simply swap out NumPy for TensorFlow, PyTorch, or JAX, and you have the ability to differentiate and train the program itself.

So what would happen if we attempted to combine the two?

Using a mixture of real Python examples and illustrated diagrams, we show how to not only evaluate, but also differentiate small quantum programs directly on quantum hardware. By extracting the gradients, we can integrate these quantum programs directly into larger differentiable programs in Python, and train/optimize the full (hybrid quantum-classical!) program. Over the course of this talk, quantum-curious Python developers will see first-hand how quantum programming looks in Python, and get an idea of how (and when) it makes sense to take advantage of these novel hardware devices.

However, the barriers to testing data processing, analysis, or model-training code are high, even with the extensive tooling that the python ecosystem offers, such as
pandas, pytest, and hypothesis.

To address this problem, in this talk I define statistical typing as a general concept describing a runtime typing system, which extends primitive data types like bool, str, and float into the class of statistical data types. By providing additional semantics about the properties held by a collection of data points, statistical typing enables us to naturally express types as multivariate schemas. It also enables us to implement schemas as generative data contracts, which serve to both validate data at runtime and generate valid samples for testing purposes.

I'll use pandera, a pandas data testing library, to illustrate how statistical typing makes data testing easier by enabling you to validate real-world data with reusable schemas and isolate units of processing, analysis, and model-training code.

You are welcome to use the setup you prefer, i.e editor, IDE, REPL. If you also like to use a JupyterLab, I recommend conda for easy installation. Similarly to virtualenv, conda allows creating isolated environments but allows binary installs for all platforms.

There are two ways to install Jupyter via conda:

1. Use Minconda. This is a small install and (after you installed it)
you can use the command conda to create an environment:
conda create -n pycon2021py39 python=3.9
Now you can change into this environment:
conda activate pycon2021py39. The prompt should change to (pycon2021py39).
Now you can install JupyterLab: conda install jupyterlab.

2. Install Anaconda and you are ready to go if you don't mind installing
lots of packages from the scientific field.

3. Install the dependencies:
* Jupyter Lab 2 conda install jupyterlab
* more_itertools conda more_itertools
* toolz conda install toolz

4. Hint: You do all this in one command:
conda create -n pycon2021py39 python=3.9 jupyterlab more-itertools toolz

You can create a comparable setup with virtual environments and pip, if you prefer.

All too often, however, spreadsheets are called upon to perform tasks that are beyond their capabilities. It’s like the old saying, 'If the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.' However, some problems are better addressed with a screwdriver, with glue, or with a Swiss Army Knife.

Python is described by some in the programming world as the Swiss Army Knife of programming languages because of its unrivaled versatility and flexibility in use. This allows its users to solve complex problems relatively easily compared with other programming languages and is one of the reasons why Python has become increasingly popular over time.

In this tutorial, we’ll briefly discuss spreadsheets, signs that you might be living in “Excel Hell”, and then we’ll spend the rest of the time learning how to escape it using Python.

In the first section, we’ll extend on what spreadsheet users already know about cells, rows, columns, and formulas, and map them to their Python equivalent, such as variables, lists, dictionaries, and functions. At the end of this section, we’ll do an interactive exercise and learn how we can perform a simple calculation, similar to one you might do in Excel, but instead using Python.

In the second section, we’ll discuss (and attempt) how we can perform more complex tasks including web scraping, data processing, analysis, and visualization, by utilizing a few popular 3rd party libraries used including Requests, Pandas, Flask, Matplotlib, and others.

In the last section, we’ll round out our discussion with a few important concepts in data management, including concept of tidy data, building a data pipeline, and a few strategies (and packages) to use when approaching various data problems, including demo using Apache Airflow.

Reading documentation is one of the first things a user of the open source library has to do.

In the Python open source community, documentation is often written using reStructuredText markup language, and built with Sphinx. The official Python documentation and Python Enhancements Proposals (PEPs) are all written using reStructuredText. Being able to write documentation using reStructuredText becomes a necessary skill for any aspiring Python open source contributors and maintainers.

Yet, reStructuredText itself can be seen as a barrier into contributing to open source, since it is not as straightforward as Markdown. Compared to Markdown, reStructuredText is not as widely adopted outside of the Python community. Don’t let this discourage you! Let’s break down this barrier! reStructuredText is not as complicated as you might think. You can learn it!

In this tutorial, we'll go through various useful features of reStructuredText. You will learn how to create and build a documentation project using Sphinx. Not only will you learn a new skill, you can also confidently start contributing to open source projects by helping to improve their documentation.

Optimising for multiple objectives is a non-trivial task, especially when they are in conflict. For example how can one best overcome the classic trade-off between quality and cost of production, when the monetary value of quality is not defined? In this hands-on Python tutorial you will learn about Pareto Fronts and use them to optimise for multiple objectives simultaneously.

Multi-Objective Optimisation, also known as Pareto Optimisation, is a method to optimise for multiple parameters simultaneously. When applicable, this method provides better results than the common practice of combining multiple parameters into a single parameter heuristic. The reason for this is quite simple. The single heuristic approach is like horse binders limiting the view of the solution space, whereas Pareto Optimisation enables a bird’s eye view.

Real world applications span from supply chain management, manufacturing, aircraft design to land use planning. For example when developing therapeutics, Pareto optimisation may help a biologist maximise protein properties like effectiveness and manufacturability while simultaneously minimising toxicity.

I will provide a git repository with Jupyter notebooks with which you will apply lessons and tools learned to the simple Knapsack problem. Here you will program for filling a bag with packages with the objective of minimising the bag weight while maximising its content value.

My objective is for you to gain a basic intuition for the technique, understand its advantages and shortcomings to be able to assess applicability for your own projects
