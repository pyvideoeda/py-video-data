An introduction to Bayesian statistics using Python. Bayesian statistics are usually presented mathematically, but many of the ideas are easier to understand computationally. People who know Python can get started quickly and use Bayesian analysis to solve real problems. This tutorial is based on material and case studies from Think Bayes (O'Reilly Media).

The goal of the tutorial is a broad-based introduction to SQLAlchemy, spanning the Core and ORM components as well as the systems that underlie them. The tutorial takes the ""harder"" approach teaching from fundamentals first, emphasizing details on how the library interacts with the database and SQL and concluding with an introduction to the ORM, providing a solid perspective for continued study.

Data is everywhere! And most of the time, the best way to find what you want in a pile of data is to search it. In this project-based tutorial, you'll get an introduction to the basic theory of search and write a program to index and search a collection of Wikipedia documents using the Whoosh library. You'll leave with the ability to add search functionality to all of your own projects.

Suppose `import` didn't exist, and we had to invent it from scratch. We'll look at the problem - code sharing and reuse across modules - and different ways we could solve it. We'll come up with `import` from parallel universes and then reinvent python's actual implementation. Finally, we'll import - using python's design - without using the `import` keyword.

Have you ever wanted to play video games while also contributing to science? In psychology experiments developed by myself and Peter Battaglia, participants are immersed in an interactive 3D world which is experimentally well-controlled, yet also extremely fun. This talk will explain how we created these ""game-like"" experiments in Python using the Panda3D video game engine.

This talk documents the journey of a less than conventional robotics application in which python is used as the logical controller of an autonomous 20 foot blimp. The blimp's autopilot features, prolonged air time, large size, and smooth motion make it the ideal platform for aerial photography. Giving the blimp an onboard controller reduces the overall costs and requirements of the operation.

The language you speak determines the thoughts you can think. Thus, API designers (and that includes you, if you've ever coined a function) have a great duty, as language inventors, to expand the mental canvases of those who come after.

Sometimes, the code you need just isn't available in Python, but someone's written some code in another language that solves your problem. What options do you have for interacting with this external code from within your program? We'll examine how to call external binaries, what happens behind the scenes at a systems level, and how these implementation details affect performance and memory usage. In the second part of the talk, we'll discuss the different options for more tightly integrating external code in the form of a C library for better performance and control.

Donald Knuth famously said that we should avoid optimization 97% of the time and focus on the ""critical 3%"". How can we identify that 3%? How can we best focus our optimization efforts, and avoid the ""root of all evil"" that is premature optimization?

Flask is a web framework for Python based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2 and good intentions. It is considered a micro-framework, but don't get the ""micro"" part fool you; Flask can do everything the ""others"" can do, many times in a simpler, leaner way. This session will introduce you to Flask as an engine to build RESTful web services.

To many developers the database is a black box. You expect to be able to put data into your database, have it to stay there, and get it out when you query it... hopefully in a performant manner. When its not performant enough the two options are usually add some indexes or throw some hardware at it. We'll walk through a bit of a clearer guide of how you can understand and manage DB performance.

Guaranteed behavior makes software modules useful. Software guarantees are commonly incomplete with good reason: promises that are narrow and few are most easily kept across wide ranges of platforms and long times. We define the space of a module's allowed behavior to be its ""behavioral envelope"" and show that thinking and speaking in terms of envelopes eases maintenance and makes APIs delightful.

Some of these addresses will connect near instantly, while others might take a long time or time out. This talk is about a Twisted endpoint API I built that takes a hostname, and returns the connection that takes the least time to complete, from the list of resolved host addresses.

Many developers, including quite a few experienced developers, are absolutely confounded by regular expressions. However, regular expressions aren't as difficult as many believe. In this talk, I will teach regular expressions by starting with the simple and moving toward the complex, so that you too can read and write regular expressions like a hero.

Ever wondered how python web-scraping libraries compare in terms of speed and accuracy? I'll review lxml, html5lib, BeautifulSoup and scrapy with a series of sites evaluating how quickly they can parse pages and how accurately they can find data, particularly pieces of data that render after DOM loading and other pesky bits like hidden form data, internationalized data and mobile-compliant sites.

The most important yet underappreciated parts of concurrent APIs are good constructs for fan-out (one thread spawns others) and fan-in (many threads join together). This talk will show examples of fan-in and fan-out. It will cover the successes and shortcomings of APIs that provide concurrency. Finally, we'll discuss how the async model of Tulip/PEP3156 is the ultimate API. The future is bright!

Celery is a distributed task queue for Python that is used by a large number of web applications to off load tasks that can be executed asynchronously. This workshop will demonstrate how we can use Celery for a use case that isn't a web site or a web application and is something which could happen in a hospital or a bank or any other such large organization.

This tutorial will offer an introduction to the core concepts of machine learning, and how they can be easily applied in Python using Scikit-learn. We will use the scikit-learn API to introduce and explore the basic categories of machine learning problems, related topics such as feature selection and model validation, and the application of these tools to real-world data sets.

Descriptors and metaclasses are advanced Python features. While it is possible to write Python programs without active of knowledge of them, knowing how they work provides a deeper understanding about the language. Using examples, you will learn how they work and when to use as well as when better not to use them. Use cases provide working code that can serve as a base for own solutions.

Getting Started With Django is a well-established series of videos teaching best practices and common approaches for building web apps to people new to Django. This tutorial combines the first few lessons into a single lesson. Attendees will follow along as I start and build an entire simple web app and, network permitting, deploy it to Heroku.
