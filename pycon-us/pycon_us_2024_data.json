        "description": "All modern systems use distributed and asynchronous tasks to make proper use of the available hardware and software resources in a safe and reliable manner. The ability to create and distribute asynchronous tasks drastically impact the performance as well as the capability of a system.\n\nThe most popular way of creating asynchronous task queues involves using streams or pub/sub infrastructures like Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, Kinesis etc, more or less, are equally suitable for a variety of scenarios.\n\nThen, the question is why we’re talking something else i.e. “Celery” over here? The answer is “Python Programming Language”.\n\nIf you're creating a system (especially microservices based and/or distributed systems) in python__ and want to create an asynchronous (and distributed) task queues which is pure python, simple, super fast, and diminishes the boundary between distributed systems_, then you should consider using “Celery”___.\n\nUsing something like “Celery” is not about being better than other solutions out there, it’s all about the ability to make use of the python ecosystem and create things faster without leaving the python programming language for something else.\n\nWelcome to this tutorial on Celery, the open source distributed task queues. In this tutorial, we'll learn how to use “Celery” and create an end to end system. We’ll also learn about how we can also visualize the distributed task queues at runtime using “Flower”\n\nThis tutorial will have classroom exercises, post class homeworks as well as complimentary readings. All the presentation, code, exercises will be shared in advance (~ 2 - 3 days) and the solutions of the exercise will be shared after the tutorial is completed.",

In this tutorial, we will explore how communities form in organizations to develop a better solution than \"The Org Chart\". We will walk through using a few key Python libraries in the space, develop a toolkit for Clustering Attributed Graphs (more on that later) and build out an extensible interactive dashboard application that promises to take your legacy HR reporting structure to the next level.\n\nDescription\nIn this tutorial, we will develop some fundamental knowledge on Graph Theory and capabilities in using key Python libraries to construct and analyze network graphs, including xarray, networkx, and dash-cytoscape. We will also dig into exploratory data analysis of people data, and use faker to generate realistic people data that matches our statistical understanding, without breaching data privacy. The goal of this talk is to build the tools you need to launch your own interactive dashboard in Python that can help explore communities of people based on shared characteristics (e.g. programming languages, projects worked on, apps used, management structure). The data we will dig into focuses on building a better understanding of developers + users and how they form communities, but this could just as easily be extended to any social network. The work we do here can be easily extended to your communities and use cases -- let's build something together!\n\nGetting Started\nBefore the tutorial, head over to https://lucasdurand.xyz/network-graph-tutorial/ for more information on setting up your environment. If you have your own people data, bring that along too and we can give it a try, but if not then we will make some synthetic data as a stand-in.",

        "description": "Full title: Tutorials: Introduction to Ibis: blazing fast analytics with DuckDB, Polars, Snowflake, and more, from the comfort of your Python repl. \n\nPresented by:\nGil Forsyth\nJim Crist-Harif\nNaty Clementi\nPhillip Cloud\n\nTabular data is ubiquitous, and pandas has been the de facto tool in Python for analyzing it. However, as data size scales, analysis using pandas may become untenable. Luckily, modern analytical databases (like DuckDB) are able to analyze this same tabular data, but perform orders-of-magnitude faster than pandas, all while using less memory. Many of these systems only provide a SQL interface though; something far different from pandas’ dataframe interface, requiring a rewrite of your analysis code.\n\nThis is where Ibis comes in. Ibis provides a common dataframe interface to many popular databases and analytics tools (BigQuery, Snowflake, Spark, DuckDB, …). This lets users analyze data using the same consistent API, regardless of which backend they’re using, and without ever having to learn SQL (but you can use SQL if you want to!). No more pains rewriting pandas code to something else when you run into performance issues; write your code once using Ibis and run it on any supported backend.\n\nIn this tutorial we’ll cover:\n\n    The basic operations of Ibis (select, filter, group_by, order_by, join, and aggregate), and how these operations may be composed to form more complicated queries.\n    How Ibis may be used on a number of different local and remote backend engines to execute the same queries on different systems.\n    The tradeoffs of different database engines, and recommendations for how to choose the best tool for the job.\n    How Ibis integrates into the larger Python data ecosystem, including tools like Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, PyArrow, pandas, Altair, and VegaFusion.\n\nThis is a hands-on tutorial, with numerous examples to get your hands dirty. Participants should ideally have some experience using Python and pandas, but no SQL experience is necessary.",

        "description": "In recent years, Rust has been getting more and more popular over other similar programming languages like C and C++ due to its robust compiler checking and ownership rules to make sure memory is safe. Hence there are more and more Python libraries that have been written in Rust natively with a Python API interface. One of the tools that have been driving this movement is PyO3, a toolset that proves Rust bindings for Python and tools for creating native Python extension modules.\n\nIn this interactive workshop, we will cover the very basics of using PyO3. There will be hands-on exercises to go from how to set up the project environment to writing a \"toy\" Python library written in Rust using PyO3. We will cover a lot of expectations of the API provided by PyO3 to create Python functions, modules, handling errors and converting types.\n\nGoal\nTo give developers who are not familiar with PyO3 an introduction to PyO3 so they can consider building their Python libraries with Rust to make use of Rust's memory-safe property and parallelism ability.\n\nTarget audiences\nAny developers who are interested in developing Python libraries using Rust. It will be an advantage if the attendees are comfortable writing in Rust. However, attendees are not required to be familiar with Rust as all the Rust codes will be provided. Basic knowledge of Python will be assumed from the attendees.",

        "description": "An astonishing 96.3% of websites have accessibility issues. As a Python developer, you can be a part of the effort to turn that number around.\n\nIn this workshop, we’ll introduce you to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and show you practical ways to incorporate accessibility into your web development. We’ll build a blog website using a Python-powered content management system called Wagtail and demonstrate how you can make your project more accessible as you go. We’ll show you how to customize Wagtail’s accessibility tools to continuously test and improve your website accessibility over time.\n\nTo benefit the most from this tutorial, students should have at least some basic knowledge of Python and Django. A laptop with Python 3.8 or above installed on it is required to participate in the hands-on exercises.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/media/presentation_slides/31/2024-05-15T15%3A44%3A59.387449/PyCon_US_-_Wagtail_Accessibility_Tutor_74sTGdT.pdf",

        "description": "Remember pointers from C/C++? Why don’t we add them to Python? Make any Python object mutable by manipulating it directly in memory through the pointer as you would do in C/C++. Why do this? Well, pointers have no use in Python, but the point is not implementation itself, but all the internal parts of Python programming language that you will touch while implementing it. What you will learn:\n\n- How to add new piece of syntax to Python. We will implement & and * (address of and dereference) operators just like in C/C++.\n\n- How to add custom builtin object. Adding new syntax has to do something, right? In our case it will operate on new pointer builtin object.\n\n- Internal layout of Python objects.\n\n- How to make our pointer object behave well. Everything in Python is an object and every object internally has to make sure it’s lifecycle does not cause any issues and your program works in a predictable way.\n\n- How to do something with new object. Having new syntax and object is cool, but it has to interact with other objects somehow. Remember double underscore methods like __add__ and __eq__? We will see how they are implemented internally and our object will have them.\n\n- How Python objects are garbage collected. Our pointer object will cover all ways Python objects can be garbage collected and all tricky parts of this process. These involve reference counting and tracing garbage collector for cyclic objects.\n\n- And many more.\n\nOptional: to minimise chances of inconsistencies, it is recommended to have Docker installed\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/media/presentation_slides/80/2024-05-25T08%3A34%3A17.223246/Pointers_in_Python.pdf",

Doing so starts with understanding the problem space. Our workshop will guide you through the process of quantifying the emissions of your Python code and integrating this awareness into your monitoring strategy.\n\nStarting with the basics of observability, an essential part of operating a deployed service, you’ll learn why it’s important to monitor your Python code, what makes a good metric, and the common pitfalls to avoid. We’ll then dive into the practical aspects of exposing and creating custom metrics, scraping and storing them in Prometheus, a time series database, and then visualising them in dashboards using Grafana.\n\nThe workshop will also include an overview of climate-conscious tech, discussing the tech industry’s contribution to the climate crisis and introducing the principles of green coding. We’ll explore techniques and libraries for extracting metrics for carbon awareness, because \"If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.\" (Peter Drucker) and guide attendees through a practical session on instrumenting your Python code for carbon emissions and visualizing this data.\n\nBy attending this workshop, you’ll gain valuable insights and hands-on experience in making your code more carbon-conscious. You’ll learn about carbon-aware workloads, strategies for making your services more energy, and carbon efficient, the importance of cloud provider regions and transparency, and how to advocate for change. These skills and knowledge can be integrated into your day-to-day work, making a real difference in our world.\n\nJoin us in this journey towards a more sustainable future in tech and a better planet for everyone.\n\n*source: https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com/#citation",

You’ll learn best practices and patterns for API authentication and authorization and for API security by design.\n\nWe’ll go through the OWASP top 10 API vulnerabilities. We’ll see practical examples of how they occur, including examples from real-world APIs. We’ll analyze the vulnerabilities, understand what the attack vectors are, and how we address them.\n\nYou’ll learn how Open Authorization (OAuth) and OpenID Connect (OIDC) work for APIs. You’ll learn about the risks and advantages of using these protocols, known vulnerabilities, and best practices to avoid them. You’ll also learn about JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and how to use them correctly for access authorization.\n\nFinally, you’ll learn how to automate the process of detecting and addressing security vulnerabilities in your APIs using fuzzy testers like schemathesis and design-testing tools like spectral.\n\nThroughout the tutorial, we’ll use examples of OpenAPI specifications, and code examples in Flask and FastAPI. You’ll make the best out of the tutorial if you have some experience working with APIs.\n\nIf you work with APIs (who doesn’t!), I’d love to welcome you to this tutorial to learn how to build and deliver secure APIs!\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/media/presentation_slides/5/2024-05-16T14%3A23%3A40.901728/2024_05_pycon_us.pptx",

        "description": "Presented by:\nPavithra Eswaramoorthy\nAndrew Huang\nDharhas Pothina\n\nAs we descend from the peak of the hype cycle around Large Language Models (LLMs), chat-based document interrogation systems have emerged as a high value practical use case. The ability to ask natural language questions and get relevant and accurate answers from a large corpus of documents can fundamentally transform organizations and make institutional knowledge accessible. Foundational LLM models like OpenAI’s GPT4 provide powerful capabilities, but using them directly to answer questions about a collection of documents presents accuracy-related limitations. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is the leading approach to enhancing the capabilities and usability of Large Language Models, especially for personal or company-level chat-based document interrogation systems.\n\nRAG is a technique to share relevant context and external information (retrieved from vector storage) to LLMs, thus making them more powerful and accurate. In this tutorial, we’ll dive into RAG by creating a personal chat application that accurately answers questions about your selected documents. We’ll use a new OSS project called Ragna that provides a friendly Python and REST API, designed for this particular case. For our example, we’ll test the effectiveness of different LLMs and vector databases. We'll then develop a web application that leverages the REST API, built with Panel–a powerful OSS Python application development framework.\n\nBy the end of this tutorial, you will have an understanding of the fundamental components that form a RAG model, and practical knowledge of open source tools that can help you or your organization explore and build on your own applications. This tutorial is designed to enable enthusiasts in our community to explore an interesting topic using some beginner-friendly Python libraries.",

        "description": "Full title: Sponsor Presentations: Avoid the top 5 web data pitfalls when developing AI models (Sponsor: Bright Data)\n\nPresented by:\nJakub Glodek\n\nData Bias: ensuring that the training data is not biased. Biased data can lead to AI models that are unfair or discriminatory. For example, if a dataset for facial recognition software predominantly contains images of people from certain ethnic groups, the model may perform poorly on faces from underrepresented groups. \n\nInsufficient Data Variety: AI models require diverse data to understand different scenarios and variations. If the training data is too homogeneous or lacks variety, the model might not perform well in real-world, diverse conditions. \n\nOverfitting and Underfitting: Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and learns to fit the training data so closely that it fails to generalize to new data. Underfitting happens when the model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data. \n\nPoor Data Quality: If the training data is full of errors, inconsistencies, or is poorly labeled, the AI model will likely inherit these flaws. Ensuring high data quality is essential for developing reliable and accurate AI models. \n\nIgnoring Data Drift: Over time, the real-world data that an AI model encounters may change or 'drift' from the data on which it was trained. This can happen due to evolving trends, behaviors, or environments. Failing to monitor and adapt to these changes can render an AI model less effective or even obsolete.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/media/presentation_slides/155/2024-05-15T23%3A29%3A58.171807/Bright_Data_ScrapeCon.pptx",

        "description": "Sponsor Presentations - An Introduction to Simulation And Ansys For Developers (Sponsor: Ansys)\n\nPresented by:\nJames Derrick\n\nNumerical simulation can be complicated and scary. Often, it is the exclusive realm of engineers and the highly trained, but it doesn't have to be that way! Simulation has a lot to offer to anyone interested in investigating the world around them and while the basics may seem overwhelming at first, it really can be valuable, and even fun to have a working knowledge of the steps involved. This presentation is designed to prepare you with a basic grounding in simulation and how it works so that you too can go away and build your own simulations, or more realistically, use simulation tools (such as Ansys) to model every day things. In particular this presentation will take you through an example script of PyMAPDL (our Open Source Python interface for Ansys' original product: Mechanical APDL), modelling a simple 2D bridge scenario.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/media/presentation_slides/168/2024-05-15T03%3A41%3A40.067703/Intro2Simulation4Developers.pdf",

Despite this, experienced developers often struggle with working as effectively with Python (e.g., writing Pythonic code) as they are with other programming languages with which they are more familiar. This talk will leverage the experiences of a professional trainer to demystify this dichotomy with the goal of understanding the motivating reasons for it, and making suggestions on how to help developers new to Python move quickly from writing Python code to writing Pythonic code.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/media/presentation_slides/157/2024-05-15T13%3A35%3A47.352866/pycon_learning_python_difficulties.pdf",

        "description": "Título completo: Personalizando LLMs: Guía para “Fine-Tuning” local de modelos Open Source en Español\n\nPresented by:\nMaria Jose Molina Contreras\n\nEn el mundo actual, los modelos de lenguaje grandes (LLM, en inglés) están revolucionando cómo interactuamos con la tecnología, permitiendo tener conversaciones, organizar datos, redactar textos, y otras actividades con mínimo esfuerzo humano.\n\nEs probable que al usar algún LLM hayas recibido respuestas incorrectas ¿a qué se debe eso? Durante el entrenamiento de estos modelos, suelen ingerir grandes cantidades de texto sin etiquetar de fuentes como libros, páginas web, foros, los cuales desarrollan un gran entendimiento de conocimiento pero carecen de conocimientos específicos. Por este motivo ajustar modelos (“Fine-Tuning”, en inglés) que han sido pre-entrenados con este gran corpus de datos es crucial para: (1) obtener mejor rendimiento en la calidad de respuestas, y (2) ajustar el modelo a un dominio específico al proporcionar textos específicos para que puedan especializarse.\n\nEntonces, ¿Por qué es necesario entender el “Fine-Tuning” en modelos locales? Dentro de los diversos motivos, uno de los más relevantes es la privacidad de datos. Puesto que al hacer el proceso de “Fine-Tuning” localmente se puede enseñar al modelo datos que son privados, como datos personales, datos clínicos, información confidencial de empresas, etc.\n\nEn esta charla, los asistentes aprenderán paso a paso cómo modelos LLM Open Source, como Mixtral-8x22B-v0.1, Mistral-7B (multi lenguaje), bloom-7b u otros modelos, son opciones muy interesantes para aprender a realizar “Fine-Tuning” y especializar modelo para el dominio específico. Además, se compartirá el rol de Python del proceso, la aplicación de módulos externos para tener una implementación simple, para realizar “Fine-Tuning” de LLMs.\n\nConocimientos generales de Data Science son recomendables para seguir la temática con facilidad, aunque se explicará de manera simplificada y yendo por todos los pasos para entender cómo se realiza “Fine-Tuning”.

        "description": "título completo: Charlas: Hackeando el Pensamiento: Traduciendo Señales Eléctricas del Cerebro en Acciones a través de Modelos LLM.\n\nPresented by:\nAdonai Vera\n\nEn esta charla única, demostraremos la increíble capacidad de \"hackear\" el cerebro humano para interactuar con tecnologías avanzadas. Usando el dispositivo Neurosity, capturaremos señales eléctricas cerebrales, que luego serán interpretadas en Python para realizar acciones específicas.\n\nEste proceso comienza con la lectura de ondas cerebrales, utilizando un clasificador para convertirlas en comandos digitales. Por ejemplo, mostraremos cómo estas señales pueden transformarse en la acción de pedir una pizza. Esta demostración práctica resalta el potencial de combinar neurotecnología con aplicaciones cotidianas.\n\nLuego, incorporaremos tecnología de voz a texto para convertir un diálogo sobre pedir una pizza en una llamada telefónica real. Esta integración multifacética ilustra la eficacia de Python en la unión de distintas tecnologías en un flujo de trabajo coherente.\n\nAdemás, compartiremos insights y recomendaciones basadas en nuestra experiencia en la implementación de estas tecnologías.

        "description": "título completo: Charlas: ¡Pero si funciona en mi computadora! Cómo lograr que nuestros análisis de datos sean reproducibles\n\nPresented by:\nRiva Quiroga\n\nLa reproducibilidad computacional no solo es un asunto de ejecución de código, sino, sobre todo, un asunto vinculado a la comunicación. Para asegurarnos de que otras personas (nuestro equipo, nuestro yo del futuro, otras colegas, etc.) puedan reproducir nuestros resultados a partir de los datos y el código que escribimos, necesitamos que nuestros proyectos comuniquen de manera clara para qué sirve cada uno de sus componentes y dónde encontrar los piezas necesarias para hacer que todo funcione. La charla tiene como audiencia objetivo a personas que usan Python para análisis de datos, tanto quienes trabajan en contextos académicos de investigación, como quienes trabajan como científicos o científicas de datos en industria. Puede ser de particular interés para quienes recién están empezando en esta área y quieren adoptar buenas prácticas. Al finalizar la charla, la audiencia tendrá una serie de lineamientos prácticos y aplicables que podrán ayudar que sus flujos de análisis de datos con Python sean reproducibles.\n\nLuego de dar algunos ejemplos de la vida real en los que (casi) todo salió mal producto de que el código no era reproducible, se abordarán los siguientes tópicos: - uso de entornos virtuales. - uso de control de versiones. - organización de directorios y archivos. - escribir funciones y automatizar tareas - cómo crear documentación útil para quienes utilizarán nuestro código en el futuro.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/media/presentation_slides/68/2024-05-17T20%3A21%3A45.733249/pero-si-funciona-en-mi-computadora.pdf",

Es importante entender que, si bien existe un importante desarrollo de tecnologías a gran escala que nos permiten trabajar con Inteligencia Artificial, Big Data, Aplicaciones Web, etc. en el mundo real, especialmente en instituciones de carácter público, se siguen utilizando y exigiendo métodos tradicionales para compartir y almacenar la información. En este trabajo “a pequeña escala”, existen desafíos como la generación de reportes automáticos en formato Word, el relleno de formularios en planillas Excel para la entrega de información oficial y la generación de aplicaciones que ayuden a las personas que no programan a realizar procesos repetitivos. Presentaré ejemplos de reportes reproducibles con Quarto, relleno automático de formatos oficiales en planillas Excel con Pandas+xlwings y generación de aplicaciones con Streamlit y Shiny. También entregaré algunos consejos sobre cómo trabajar colaborativamente con personas que no programan y cómo desarrollar soluciones con Python que puedan ser utilizadas dentro del contexto del trabajo de oficina diario.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/media/presentation_slides/96/2024-05-18T18%3A09%3A38.025288/pycon2024_stephanie_orellana.pptx",

        "description": "La inteligencia artificial ha sido parte de nuestro ecosistema tecnológico desde ya hace algunos años, pero su estallido se dio con el despliegue de Gen AI y LLMs que aumento su popularidad marcando un antes y un después. Actualmente, la comunidad tecnológica muestra un gran interés en aprender a desarrollar aplicaciones haciendo uso de este tipo de tecnología, en ese contexto sin duda Python es el lenguaje por excelencia.\n\nEn esta charla exploraremos técnicas clave, como el Fine Tunning y el Transfer Learning aplicadas a modelos super conocidos como GPT-3.5 Turbo/GPT4 e inclusive modelos de código abierto disponibles en Hugging Face. Veremos como adaptar estos modelos a nuestros propios casos de uso en las apps que queramos desarrollar.\n\nAdemás de entrenar modelos, también hablaremos acerca de cómo realizar consultas de información a bases de datos vectoriales (vector search) para localizar información dentro de un determinado documento y poder generar contenido sintético en base a esta búsqueda.\n\nEn esta misma línea aprenderemos que son los embeddings, como trasformar nuestra información no estructurada en vectores y luego como indexarla en estas bases de datos vectoriales para un acceso más eficiente.\n\nTodo esto utilizando Python y sus poderosas bibliotecas, entre las cuales utilizaremos transformers, langChain y PyTorch.\n\nPara lograr esto daré una introducción para poner en contexto al público, para luego pasar a demostraciones prácticas de cómo realizar estas operaciones de manera comprensible, tal como a mí me hubiera gustado que me lo explicaran.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/media/presentation_slides/2/2024-05-18T17%3A03%3A31.495570/PYCON_2024_JORGE.pdf",

I'll be presenting a new Python framework \"memhive\", which implements a worker pool of subinterpreters, efficient RPC mechanism between them, async/await-ready API, as well as fundamental data structures ( tuples, mappings and scalar types).\n\nI'll demonstrate that it's possible to unlock true parallelism with subinterpreters without paying the overhead of data serialization. I'll explain how this is possible and what algorithms under the hood drive this.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/media/presentation_slides/67/2024-05-18T03%3A28%3A48.709949/subint.pdf",

        "description": "Full title: Unlocking the Parallel Universe: Subinterpreters and Free-Threading in Python 3.13\n\nPresented by:\nAnthony Shaw\n\nPython 3.12 introduced a new parallel execution model called \"sub interpreters\" that uses a per-interpreter GIL to unlock a new way of writing parallel code that's faster than multiprocessing. Python 3.13 introduces another new parallel execution model called \"free-threading\" (previously called no-gil) that replaces that optionally removes the GIL so that threads can truly be parallel. Does free-threading make sub interpreters redundant? We'll answer that question in this talk. We unpack what sub interpreters are, how to use them and their limitations. We'll explore free-threading, the optional flag to remove the GIL in 3.13. Finally we look at a use case for sub interpreters and free-threading together, a multi-worker, multi-thread ASGI web server. We benchmark this against traditional web server architecture with multiprocessing and threading. So fasten your seatbelts, fellow Pythonistas! Let’s ride the comet tail of parallelism, leaving behind the single-threaded past. 🚀✨",

We have many excellent DataFrame libraries in Python and they give us the flexibility to manipulate data to our hearts content. But what happens when comes to presenting tables to others?\n\nThe display of tables can be beautiful. Tables can convey information effectively, just as plots do and, sometimes, it’s the better way to present data. Truly, the time has come to bridge the divide between raw DataFrame output and wondrously-structured tables suitable for publication.\n\nLet's review the state of ‘display tables’ in 2024. We’ll go over which table components make for effective displays of information. It’s surprising but there are many considerations that go into making a well-crafted table. We’ll take a look at the combinations of Python packages that fit together to make this important task possible, and marvel together at the tabular results they can provide.",

Also, you will be surprised to learn it is not what you probably think it is.\n\nPython 3.12 will include support for the Linux perf profiler. The Linux perf profiler is a very powerful tool that allows you to profile and obtain information about the performance of your application. perf also has a very vibrant ecosystem of tools that help with the analysis of the data that it produces.\n\nIn this talk, we will talk about how this exciting feature was implemented, how the support provided by the perf profiler differs from other performance-oriented profilers for Python, and how it can be used effectively, including how to activate it dynamically to enable production profiling. We will also cover some of the requirements that are needed to obtain the best results, as well as some of the limitations of the implementation and how those can affect your metrics.\n\nBeing able to understand where our Python applications are expending their time is crucial to being able to improve the performance characteristics of our applications. Several tools already exist to help with this task, but they all have their own limitations, especially when native code written in C, C++, Rust, etc. is involved. Being able to gather and cross-correlate performance information with other performance-related markers, such as branch mispredictions, cache misses, context switches, and other events, can be key in understanding some of the most challenging profiling puzzles.",

We’ll show how we use these more dynamic features of Python to effectively accelerate any code that uses pandas, including third-party libraries. We’ll also get into the technical and social problems that currently necessitate these sophisticated solutions, and share some thoughts on solving them. It will be a story of successes, failures, wishes and tears, and excursions into exciting parts of Python many developers may not have encountered before!\n\nThis talk is for the Pythonista interested in the import system and how to hack it for performance. It is also for developers interested in the question of speeding up the vast ecosystem built on top of libraries like numpy and pandas without code changes.",

        "description": "Would you like to use large language models (LLMs) in your own project, but are troubled by their tendency to frequently “hallucinate”, or produce incorrect information? Have you ever wondered if there was a way to easily measure an LLM’s hallucination rate, and compare this against other models? And would you like to learn how to help LLMs produce more accurate information?\n\nIn this talk, we’ll have a look at some of the main reasons that hallucinations occur in LLMs, and then focus on how we can measure one specific type of hallucination: the tendency of models to regurgitate misinformation that they have learned from their training data. We’ll explore how we can easily measure this type of hallucination in LLMs using a dataset called TruthfulQA in conjunction with Python tooling including Hugging Face’s datasets and transformers packages, and the langchain package.\n\nWe’ll end by looking at recent initiatives to reduce hallucinations in LLMs, using a technique called retrieval augmented generation (RAG). We’ll look at how and why RAG makes LLMs less likely to hallucinate, and how this can help make these models more reliable and usable in a range of contexts.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/media/presentation_slides/48/2024-05-10T12%3A35%3A48.498968/lies-damned-lies-and-llms-final-speaker-notes.pdf",

With Ruff, projects can replace dozens of static analysis tools with a single dependency, all while executing 10x, 100x, or even 1000x faster.\n\nOver the past year, Ruff has grown to millions of downloads per month, and now powers static analysis for the largest projects in the Python ecosystem, including NumPy, Pandas, PyTorch, LangChain, and more.\n\nThis talk will open with a brief overview of Ruff’s functionality before diving into its internals, with a focus on performance. In particular, we’ll look to answer the question: what does it take to build a developer tool that’s orders of magnitude faster than the alternatives?\n\nOur exploration will be grounded in specific optimizations and design decisions that make Ruff fast. Along the way, we’ll also explore the broader tradeoffs that come with building developer tools for Python, in Rust.\n\nAlthough Ruff is written in Rust, no Rust knowledge is required. Instead, this talk is aimed at those interested in building performant developer tools for any domain, in any language.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/media/presentation_slides/22/2024-05-16T16%3A51%3A47.243275/PyCon.pdf",

There are examples of success stories such as PyCon US Charlas, PyLadies, Djangonaut, and Django Girls. Yet in the Python podcast community, women are still underrepresented, making up only 17% of invited guests among the popular podcast series. Being a guest in a podcast is a privilege, and an opportunity to influence the Python community. There are many women and underrepresented group members who have made impactful contributions to the Python community globally, and they deserve the recognition and to be heard by the rest of us. Disheartened by the lack of representation by women on Python podcasts, and inspired by others who have shown us how diversity in the community can be improved through intentionality, we decided to start a podcast with a goal to highlight their voices so that they could receive the recognition they deserve. In this talk,earn about them, and about our podcast series. We’ll also share how you can further help out cause in improving representation and diversity in the Python community.\nGoal\n\nTo raise awareness of the underrepresentation of certain groups, especially women. To acknowledge the progress made by the Python community and what can be done further to continue the improvement.\nTarget Audience\n\nAnyone who cares about the diversity and inclusion progression in the Python community.

        "description": "As we are in an era of big data where large groups of information are assimilated and analyzed, for insights into human behavior, data privacy has become a hot topic. Since there is a lot of private information which once leaked can be misused, all data cannot be released for research. So, how should privacy be protected in the environment where data is stored and shared at such an escalating pace? One might think that simply making personally identifiable fields in the dataset anonymous might be useful, but this can lead to the entire dataset becoming useless and not fit for analysis. And research has proven that by statistically studying both the datasets, private information can easily be re-extracted!\n\nThe session will start with a brief on the current standards of privacy, and the possible risks of handling customer data. This will lay the foundation for introducing Differential Privacy, a cutting-edge technique of cybersecurity that claims to preserve an individual’s privacy, by manipulating data in such a way as to not render it useless for data analysis. Attendees will gain an insight into the concept of Differential Privacy, how it is employed to minimize the risks associated with private data, its practical applications in various domains, and how Python eases the task of employing it in our models with PyDP. As the talk progresses, a walkthrough of a real-life practical example, along with a nifty visualization will acquaint the audience with PyDP, and how differential private results come out to be in approximation to what unfiltered data would have provided.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/media/presentation_slides/108/2024-05-17T16%3A05%3A59.414232/Differential_Privacy.pptx.pdf",

        "description": "Python packaging can be a scary and confusing endeavor. The ecosystem can be thorny and filled with many decisions around which tool or approach to use. You’re also likely to get pricked by an approach or tutorial that doesn't work as expected. However, the packaging journey doesn’t have to be prickly - particularly for pure Python packages. By building community consensus around user goals and moderating healthy discussion, pyOpenSci is paving a smooth, thorn-free path for successful packaging.\n\nThis talk presents pyOpenSci’s people-first approach to guiding the scientific community through thorny packaging decisions. First, we engaged with the broader community to understand packaging needs. Second, we brought together packaging experts, tool maintainers, and beginning-to-advanced users to successfully build consensus around tools and best practices. Community outreach helped us understand both user needs and the packaging tool ecosystem. Finally, consensus around tools and needs was transformed into accessible recommendations in our community-driven Packaging Guide. Guidebook pull requests go through extensive, open community review with 38 people and thousands of comments contributing to the guidebook’s current state. Careful moderation ensures healthy and productive conversations and also drives consensus-building around beginner-friendly content. Our guidebook’s development process allows us to harness community expertise to create an accessible and accurate packaging guide that smooths out the packaging path.\n\nYou will will walk away from this talk with a better understanding of:\n\n    Why consensus-building and user-focused content development is critical for tackling thorny topics such as packaging.\n    How to decide which packaging tools satisfy your packaging needs.\n    Where to find more information and support around packaging.\n\nYou don’t have to package alone. The vibrant Python community is here to help.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/media/presentation_slides/34/2024-05-18T13%3A27%3A50.285095/pycon-talk-2024.pdf",

        "description": "Southeast Alaska is a temperate rainforest, and landslides have been happening here for thousands of years. But shifting rainfall patterns have increased the frequency of landslides, with catastrophic results. In the last 8 years, three different towns in our region have experienced fatal landslides.\n\nAfter a major landslide in 2015, a number of local people with experience in the outdoors and in various scientific fields noticed a possible correlation between river levels and landslide activity. Our main river has a small watershed, so it responds rapidly to periods of heavy precipitation. Using Python, I was able to investigate the question we all kept coming back to:\n\nIs the correlation between changing river levels and landslide activity strong enough to serve as the basis for predicting landslides?\n\nUsing historical readings from a local river gage, a set of conditions was identified that correlate meaningfully with landslide activity. In about 12 events where the river met those conditions, at least 5 were associated with known landslides.\n\nI posted a landslide-risk monitoring tool in 2021, which provides a visual indication of when the river is behaving in a way that correlates with previously known landslide events. This tool is used by many community members to assess the ongoing risk of landslide activity during heavy rain events. Just as importantly, it helps people let go of anxiety when we're experiencing rain that feels heavy, but isn't actually associated with landslide risk.\n\nThis talk will show how Python's vast ecosystem supports the entire citizen-scientist lifecycle, from idea to public-facing resource.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/media/presentation_slides/54/2024-05-17T14%3A51%3A13.415744/pycon_2024_landslide-10.pdf",

        "description": "Modifying existing code is just the worst. It's a tangled mess of dependencies, you don't know the original author's intent, and simple changes feel like they break the world. But it can be better. Wouldn't it be nice to be in a codebase where you primarily added new code and didn't touch the old stuff? We can achieve this by viewing your code through the lens of extensibility.\n\nIn this talk, you'll learn what extensibility means, and some common patterns for making your code more extensible. We'll take a hard look at the Open-Closed Principle and how to deal with a mess of dependencies. We'll then walk through how to make your code composable so that it's easier to build up abstractions. We'll finish off by looking through two architectural styles that promote extensilbility: event-driven architectures and pluggable architectures.\n\nSoftware is going to change (that's why we call it \"soft\"ware). That's inevitable. How your codebase withstands that change is up to you. Don't write a tangled, fragile mess that is incomprehensible. Make it easy to extend, and you'll greatly extend the lifetime of your products.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/media/presentation_slides/78/2024-05-17T01%3A33%3A03.151834/Extensible_Python.pdf",

        "description": "Many of us use debuggers, from the basic standard library pdb to many other fancier alternatives, but what makes it possible to debug Python code? Have you ever wondered why the entry function of pdb is named pdb.set_trace()?\n\nTo make a basic debugger, you need to be able to: \n* Stop the program at a certain position \n* View as much information as possible in a convenient way \n* Evaluate expressions and even run arbitrary code \n* Control the program execution\n\nHow does Python debugger like pdb achieve this? We will discuss the magic of sys.settrace, and the rich runtime information Python provides.\n\nHowever, there's still a pitfall. The mechanism introduces a huge overhead in order to achieve features like breakpoints. Can we do something about it? Can we have a overhead-free debugger that can do exactly what pdb can do now?\n\nIt becomes possible with PEP 669, the low-cost monitoring system introduced in Python 3.12. We will talk about the difference between the current mechanism based on sys.settrace and PEP 669, or sys.monitoring. With proper implementation, we can achieve 100x speed up for breakpoints.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/media/presentation_slides/6/2024-05-17T02%3A51%3A17.540542/PyCon2024-TianGao.pptx",

        "description": "Full title: Open Source Industrial Control: Turning 2,800 Tons of Metal with Python and Flask\n\nThis is a story of how Python can fit into the physical world around us. It is a story of system design and product development. It is a tale of great breadth, covering distributed computing, custom printed circuits, electromagnetism, some of the largest hydropower generators in the world, and the software and hardware that brings this all together. This tale covers several years of research and development, culminating in a cyber physical system built on open-source software and easily attainable off-the-shelf products and components.\n\nThe Bureau of Reclamation is the 2nd largest hydropower generator in the United States and operates 53 hydroelectric plants with 14.7 gigawatts of installed capacity. On average, Reclamation plants generate 40 billion kilowatt hours of electricity annually. It takes a large fleet of rotating machines (generators and pumps) across the western United States to produce this much electricity, and operations and maintenance of this fleet is a significant part of Reclamation’s annual budget.\n\nDuring routine diagnostic and maintenance tasks, it is often necessary to slowly and precisely turn a machine’s rotor to make measurements at various rotational positions. This was previously done with many personnel climbing into the machine and pushing (or, for very large machines, complicated crane maneuvers). This is dangerous, inefficient, and lacks precision.\n\nWith custom software and intelligent system design, we have developed a modular system that can easily scale to turn even our largest machines with the click of a button. The software can track the machine’s rotational position in real time to one thousandth of a degree and can easily expand to accommodate future diagnostic test methods. What once put personnel at risk and potentially took days to carry out can now be done in hours with little to no risk to personnel.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/media/presentation_slides/59/2024-05-15T19%3A12%3A48.417762/pycon_2024-open_source_industrial_control.pptx",

        "description": "Pandas was the dominant local data processing framework for majority of the last decade. Now, there are many other options available like Polars and DuckDB. Is it worth switching to them? One of the main reasons developers switch is because of the supposed speed. TPCH benchmarks show Polars and DuckDB are an order of magnitude faster than Pandas (and Dask) because of the Rust-based or C++ implementation.\n\nFor large-scale data, we are often told to use pure native Spark whenever possible. Pandas UDFs are often discouraged because they are deemed as a bottleneck. The optimizer works best when it can see the entire query plan, but Pandas UDFs are a black box.\n\nBut as practitioners, we have to ask two related questions: 1. Are these assumptions true? Is it universally true that Pandas and Pandas UDFs are slower? 2. Even if it it slower, is it worth the development overhead to avoid using Pandas?\n\nIn this talk, we'll show benchmarks across data of various sizes to show that these common assumptions are not always true. In fact, we'll see that Pandas UDFs can actually be faster than native Spark in some cases. With this result in mind, data practitioners should just focus on the tools that serve them best rather than adjusting to the tools.",

        "description": "Have you ever wondered how to find connections in your data and to gain insights from them? Come discover how NetworkX makes this easy (and fast!).\n\nThis talk is broadly divided into two parts. First we will talk about the power of graph analytics and how you can use tools like NetworkX to extract information from your data, and then we will talk about how we made the machinery behind NetworkX work with heterogeneous backends like GraphBLAS (CPU optimized) and cuGraph (GPU optimized).\n\nPart I\n\nNetworkX is the most popular library in Python for graph theory and applied network science thanks to its extensive API and beginner-friendly documentation. NetworkX is used \"everywhere\", because graphs are everywhere. Don't believe me? We surveyed more than 300 Python packages to understand how they use NetworkX in domains ranging from geoscience, neuroscience, genomics, biology, chemistry, quantum computing, text and language, machine learning, causal inference, optimization, and more. We will summarize what we learned to help you apply graph analytics to your data.\n\nOnce you start using NetworkX you will soon realize that the pure-Python implementation starts becoming a roadblock to scalable graph analytics. This takes us to the second part of the talk...\n\nPart II\n\nWhat should you do when your graph data becomes too large or NetworkX becomes too slow? Simple: use an accelerated NetworkX backend!\n\nNetworkX 3.0 added the ability to dispatch to other implementations. This means you can use other highly tuned libraries from NetworkX to achieve up to 100 to 10_000+ times speedup! As \"the API for graphs\", NetworkX now makes it easy to accelerate your graph workflows on CPUs with GraphBLAS and NVIDIA GPUs with nx-cugraph. Other backends are welcome, and we plan to support distributed graphs soon for extreme scalability 🚀",

        "description": "The Python ecosystem has historically relied on OpenSSL (and its myriad forks) to provide an implementation of X.509 path validation, a little-known but essential component of every secure HTTPS connection made on the modern Internet. This has brought technical debt, developer frustration (due to OpenSSL's poorly documented implementation quirks), and a mottled security history.\n\nThis talk introduces an alternative, developed over the past year: a new implementation of X.509 path validation, written from the ground-up in a memory-safe language with standards conformance as a priority, newly integrated into PyCA Cryptography, Python's most popular cryptographic library. We'll cover the work's implementation details, strategies applied for reducing complexity, technical decisions and tradeoffs made in its Rust components, as well as the work's impact on the millions of Python developers that depend on PyCA Cryptography and PyCA pyOpenSSL. Particular attention will be dedicated to the work's critical security scope and accompanying testing philosophy, including developed strategies for reaching perfect test coverage and avoiding vulnerability classes that have historically afflicted X.509 path validation implementations.\n\nThe audience is expected to have an intermediate familiarity with general Python development, including a high-level familiarity with SSL/TLS and HTTPS (but not X.509 or X.509 path validation). Audience members will leave the talk with a more complete understanding of the modern Internet's security model, as well as how the Python ecosystem is maturing to accomodate modern cryptographic best practices in networked settings.",

        "description": "“It says the package is not installed?” is a common refrain when working on software projects, especially in Python. Creating and configuring reproducible environments is a major part of modern software development and has led to the popularity of tools like Docker to specify where and how code runs. Development (Dev) Container are an open specification that extends Docker images to make it easy to configure not only the where the code runs, but also the developer workspace in your preferred editors or toolchains like VS Code, PyCharm, or DevPod. Setting up Dev Containers for your projects can reduce maintainer overhead of OSS projects, bootstrap contributors, and make running events like workshops or sprints go more smoothly.\n\nIn this talk, we will briefly cover why setting up container infrastructure can be useful for isolating your project environments and dig into how you can extend that with Dev Containers to configure a complete development experience using VS Code. We will look at two common OSS project situations, onboarding and workshops, to see how workflows for using Dev Containers and other supporting tools make things easier. No container experience required, brief familiarity with VS Code is helpful, but not necessary.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/media/presentation_slides/123/2024-05-18T16%3A59%3A27.169760/pycon-2024-eternal-sunshine.pptx",

But they don't need to merely sit on a shelf as museum objects—they can be reverse engineered and then adapted to modern computers without modifying the original hardware.\n\nCircuitPython, an implementation of the Python language for microcontrollers, is an excellent language for projects like these, thanks to native USB Human Interface Device (HID) support and the ability to ‘bitbang’ archaic interfaces combined with the fast development cycle of an interpreted language, as you'll learn in case studies adapting these keyboards & mice.\n\nNo previous experience with CircuitPython is necessary. Some knowledge of electronics will enhance your enjoyment of this talk, though there will be a quick summary of key electronics concepts as the talk proceeds.",

        "description": "AI research is more important now than ever. Trust in AI is critical, but it’s hard to build trust without metrics and documentation. How can we make documentation as easy as possible in order to maintain trust in the results from our research? Is there a way to organize our models so that we can ensure reproducibility? How can we save ourselves precious development time by automating parts of the metric tracking process?\n\nIn this talk, we’ll give a brief introduction to a popular metric tracking tool, MLFlow, before going into a deep dive on three lesser known features that can enhance collaboration, increase transparency and reduce the time wasted reproducing results.\n\nThe three features that we’ll talk about are autologging, MLFlow system tags and the MLFlow model registry. We’ll see how using these three features can save you tons of time that would have otherwise been wasted writing lines of code, looking for old code or finding the right model version.\n\nBy the end of this talk, you’ll have all the knowledge you need to successfully use MLFlow to your best advantage. You’ll be able to automatically log every parameter and metric according to your framework of choice, link the version of code to the metrics that version produced for faster reproducibility and have a process that you can reliably use to write helpful documentation quickly.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/media/presentation_slides/74/2024-05-15T18%3A13%3A55.322433/Trust_Fall_-_Hidden_Gems_in_MLFlow.pdf",

        "description": "Vogue Dance is a dance form that emerged in LGBTQIA+ culture and has become a global phenomenon, full of complex movements, creativity and social connections. Graphs are powerful tools for analyzing and visualizing interconnected networks. To organize a choreography using graphs, you first need to create a directed graph that represents the sequence of movements in the choreography. Each node will have a picture that represents a specific pose, and each edge represents the connection between the poses. The sequence used to change from one pose to the next will represent the movement. Graphs can be used to facilitate the creation of a choreography, allowing you to visualize the sequence of movements and the relationship between them. At the end of this lecture, we hope to put together a choreography based on the poses presented. The order of the poses can be chosen manually or generated at random.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/media/presentation_slides/11/2024-05-11T04%3A09%3A34.348591/pycon_-_vogue.pdf",

        "description": "Do you want to learn robotics but are unable to sink thousands of dollars into a new hobby? Good news! It turns out that many professional roboticists rarely touch hardware at all! Many modern robot developers use simulations, basically fancy video games, to develop the source code for their robots. This new approach to robotics means you too can start learning robotics without ever touching an Allen wrench or a soldering iron. More importantly, you can transfer your existing Python skills into solving challenging robotics problems.\n\nIn this talk we’ll walk you through getting started with Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) and the Gazebo simulator. ROS 2 and Gazebo are two large, open-source projects used by thousands of companies, and tens of thousands of developers, to build the robots we encounter in our daily lives. Better yet, both ROS 2 and Gazebo support Python, making it easier than ever to learn robotics fundamentals. In fact, ROS should be very familiar, it draws much of a project structure from Python itself. Just like the Python 2 to Python 3 transition. ROS and Gazebo have seen some major changes in the past few years; and now is a good time for Python developers to revisit these important tools.\n\nIn this talk we’ll introduce you to ROS 2 and Gazebo using existing open source libraries and robots. We’ll touch on how to get started, the Python APIs for both projects, and some of the fiddly bits in between (like CLIs, and other file types) that make robotics simulation possible. This talk is geared towards novice to intermediate programmers who are ready to branch out and start applying programming fundamentals to the domain of robotics.",

        "description": "Full title: How two undergrads from the other side of the planet are speeding up your future code\n\nPresented by:\nKen Jin\nJules Poon\n\nCPython 3.13 is planned to get cool new performance features. One of them is an experimental runtime bytecode optimizer, which will optimize bytecode on the fly using compiler optimizations. It aims to do fancy-sounding things like type propagation, guard elimination, constant promotion and more!\n\nWhat’s less known - this optimizer is currently being built by a university undergraduate 😲, with earlier iterations contributed by another undergrad. We’re also receiving course credit for it! One of us had no prior experience contributing to CPython.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll split our time 60-40, with some time for the performance enthusiasts out there, and the remaining time on our experience contributing to CPython as an (in our opinion) underrepresented group, and how you can contribute to CPython as a university student as well.\n\nYou don’t have to be a compiler or CPython expert to attend – this talk is aimed at everyone who can read and write some Python.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/media/presentation_slides/1/2024-05-19T04%3A20%3A45.412287/PyCon_US_2024_1.pdf",

        "description": "Decorators are powerful, magical syntax sugar, offering a convenient way to wrap and enhance functions. But sometimes, it's not clear how to use a defined decorator.\n\nWhat arguments should we pass to a given decorator? What functions does it target? Does it change the return type of the wrapped function? Have you ever faced these questions?\n\nIf proper type hints are defined for decorators, static type checkers like mypy and pyright IDEs will point out the errors in usage. Thus, guiding you on the right path by catching bugs earlier, reducing unnecessary debugging and unexpected runtime behaviour.\n\nThis talk will step you through type definitions utilizing typing.TypeVarTuple, typing.Protocol, typing.ParamSpec, typing.Concatenate, Type Parameter Syntax, and more, all of which are practical to implement and can make your project robust!\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/media/presentation_slides/42/2024-05-15T14%3A31%3A41.466815/Enhancing_Decorators_with_Type_Annotat_9JyJZu8.pdf",

        "description": "For most people that use Python, worrying about memory is not an issue. But that's not the case when you have to handle a lot of requests on a large scale. So how do you reduce memory consumption without affecting the CPU?\n\nIn this presentation I'll discuss about memory management in Python from the basics, where the necessity for PEP 683 came from, and the changes introduced by it. I also intend to discuss why this PEP is so important for the language, and what we'll be able to achieve with it in the future, such as changes to the GIL and true parallelism.\n\nThe talk is targeted for folks who are intermediate/advanced pythonistas. People who are just starting with Python (maybe less than 1.5 years) may feel a bit lost. Even so, curious learners are more than welcome to join, and I'll try my best to make it easy for all audiences on this advanced topic. After this presentation, participants will learn a bit more about how memory management works under the hood in python, and how it may change in the next couple of years.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/media/presentation_slides/72/2024-05-14T03%3A29%3A22.102640/PEP_683__Immortal_Objects_-_A_new_appr_PexB14Y.pdf",

        "description": "In the early days, people wrote small applications in assembly language, using gotos to get around. This didn't scale, so we traded gotos for structured functions with single entry and exit points—and then we added a new kind of goto with the exception, which not only blows up your function but can end up anywhere. This makes functions difficult to compose. We’ll look at strategies in Python that bring exceptions under control and make functions composable again, including the third-party returns library.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/media/presentation_slides/23/2024-05-17T15%3A22%3A34.929452/Slides.pdf",

        "description": "The last few years have seen Rust burst onto the scene as a language for implementing much-loved software for the Python ecosystem. The most well known examples of these are pydantic, polars, cryptography, and ruff.\n\nThese Rust components are usually built on top of PyO3, a Rust library for binding the two languages together, and maturin, a PEP517 build backend for Rust software. There are a growing number of talks, blogs, and guides showing how to use these tools.\n\nIn this talk I'll lead you through the details of how a Python function call ends up executing Rust code via PyO3. We'll first spend some time introducing some key ideas as well as the benefits of adding Rust to your Python stack. I'll then break down step-by-step what happens inside the Python interpreter and PyO3's internals as a seemingly simple enough Python expression leads to execution of your Rust function.\n\nYou should walk away from this talk with an idea of how Rust/PyO3 software works under the hood. These same stages of a \"native\" function call are similar for multiple other languages too, including Python standard library \"builtins\", Cython code, and C++/pybind11 software, so this may bring you some useful insight even if Rust is not planned to be in your software stack soon.\n\nWhile this talk will get technical, no knowledge of Rust will be assumed. An understanding of Python functions and types will be useful, as I'll use these to introduce the analogous Rust concepts. Expect to see Rust code (and maybe a little C), but only for illustration - all code will be broken down and stepped through.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/media/presentation_slides/89/2024-05-18T11%3A49%3A35.866887/How_Python_Harnesses_Rust_through_PyO3_nN7MfDq.pdf",

In this talk, we will write some python data analysis code in Cython, read some parts of its generated code to understand what all Python has to do to run it, and understand how long different things take by running microbenchmarks. We will then see how simple hints to Cython can help it generate faster code, and see how fast it gets. This talk is intended for Python users writing performance sensitive applications, who are at least mildly familiar with Cython and/or C/C++. Attendees will learn how to profile and optimize common operations, which should help them to evaluate Cython or Python for their use-case.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/media/presentation_slides/36/2024-05-19T15%3A05%3A14.536266/v3.pdf",

        "description": "SPy is a brand new statically typed variant of Python which aim to get performance comparable to system languages such as C and C++, while preserving the \"Pythonic feeling\" of the language.\n\nThe main idea behind SPy is that \"modern Python\" is actually a subset of Python:\n\n    many of the most dynamic features of the language are considered bad practice and actively discouraged;\n\n    the alway-increasingly adoption of typing leads to codebases which are largerly statically typed.\n\nHowever, these rules are not enforced by the language, and there are cases in which \"breaking the rules\" is actually useful and make the code easier/better/faster.\n\nFrom the point of view of language implementors, the VM cannot easily take advantage of the \"mostly static\" nature of programs because it has always to be ready for the generic case.\n\nSPy tries to reconcile these two sides:\n\n    it uses a static type system which is designed specifically for safety and performance;\n\n    the vast majority of \"dynamic\" feature of Python (like decorators, metaclasses, __special_methods__, ...) can be used at zero cost, since they are resolved at compile time by using meta-programming and partial evaluation techniques.\n\nThis talk will present in the details the ideas behind SPy and its current status.",

        "description": "In today's IDE-land, we've often overheard conversations between developers about new features being added to their editor-of-choice and how editor XYZ is better than ABC (vim vs emacs vs VSCode vs IntelliJ, we know the drill). This talk doesn't stoke fire to that debate in any direction (since different things work for different people). But, a very important tool that often powers most of the magical features that come with modern software development is the LSP server. The LSP server often keeps chugging in the background, tirelessly providing the user with diagnosis regarding the codes, autocompleting variables, and formatting the codebase to maintain prettiness. While various elements such as parsing, linting, and formatting have long existed, it is the LSP server that seamlessly unifies these features in an editor-agnostic manner.\n\nLSP servers are used everywhere, often installed individually by the user even, but there aren't many resources regarding how to actually build a functional server that can do more than send /\"Hello Editor World!\"/ messages to the editor. This talk aims to fill in that gap to provide a blueprint of steps that anyone who wants to implement an LSP server in Python can follow. Following this talk will provide a better understanding of the JSON-RPC protocol used by LSP servers to communicate with the client, diagnosis that a server can share with the user and pitfalls that one can fall into while implementing their own server. It will end with a live demonstration of a toy-LSP server that provides the basic functionalities to an editor client.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/media/presentation_slides/29/2024-05-14T03%3A18%3A23.117527/LSP_Demystified_-_2.pdf",

        "description": "Binary extensions underlie much of the modern Python ecosystem, providing performance and access to a wealth of existing code. Packaging for these libraries is rapidly changing from thousands of lines of distutils and setuptools based hackery to build systems designed for binaries like scikit-build-core, meson-python, and maturin. NumPy, for example, went from around 13K to 2K lines of building related code by moving to Meson in NumPy 1.26.\n\nThese build systems provide a much more integrated experience than was previously possible for compiled extensions. For example, CMake or Ninja are only required if the system doesn’t already provide an appropriate copy, which allows building with an external ninja/cmake on systems without binary wheels on PyPI like Pyodide, BSD, and Android. Modern editable installs are supported. Support for advanced features like ABI3 wheels or wheels that don’t call CPython is usually just a single configuration option.\n\nWe will look at how easy it is now to set up a binary extension using CMake, Meson, or Maturin (Rust only). It can be done with only three files each containing only a handful of lines of code. Unlike the previous solutions, this covers cross-compilation,multithreaded builds, modern C++ standards, and other features that would each require custom code in a classic setup.py. Combined with cibuildwheel for building wheels and good support from modern binding tools like pybind11 and nanobind, the barrier for entry to reliable compiled extensions has dropped dramatically.\n\nWe will also look at the challenges and solutions from some larger conversions to modern build systems, like NumPy’s and RAPIDS.ai.\n\nAfter this talk, you will know how to easily create compiled extensions to solve problems you encounter, and how to move existing projects to these modern build systems.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/media/presentation_slides/112/2024-05-17T13%3A51%3A23.958689/PyCon_2024.pdf",

        "description": "Given the results it can deliver (and its inherent complexity), geospatial data often takes center stage in projects it's incorporated into. Its star power and intimidating array of fellow-travelers (GDAL, et al) can make it easy to discount its value in simpler supporting roles or behind-the-scenes. Looking beyond the typical analysis and visualization toolchains--and their extreme learning curves--this talk demonstrates some comparatively low-lift patterns for leveraging geodata in a web application back end.\n\nWe'll begin by briefly discussing how geospatial data differs from other data types, how it is commonly formatted and made available, and which aspects (spatial reference identifiers, e.g.) are crucial to maintaining data correctness. Having laid out a few fundamentals we will look at PostGIS, an open-source extension to PostgreSQL which enables support for spatial datatypes, functions, and indexes. Finally, we'll look at an example application based on the FastAPI web framework which uses features of Pydantic and SQLAlchemy + GeoAlchemy 2 to implement custom geospatial validations for inbound requests.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/media/presentation_slides/97/2024-05-15T21%3A17%3A46.498628/Geospatial-Validations.pdf",

        "description": "Debugging is one of the hardest parts of our jobs. Experienced developers shrug it off as an inevitability of life, but it's one of the biggest obstacles standing in the way of newcomers. While working as a mentor, the pain of this fact became ever so vivid for me. Inspired by Bret Victor's \"Inventing on Principle\" and Redux, I went on a quest to find out if time-travel debugging was possible.\n\nIn my journey, I created a time-travel debugger for Python: Rewind. Rewind is a fork of CPython. It works by logging each state change to a file as the Python interpreter runs. Then, another program reads back the log file, recreates all historical states of the program and saves them to a database. A debugger GUI allows the user to step through the program line by line both forward and backward.\n\nDeveloping software using a time-travel debugger is a uniquely pleasant experience. It removes the anxiety of using a regular step debugger by allowing you to \"undo\". It's often more productive to start at the end where an error occurred, then step in reverse to go towards its cause. Moreover, omniscience - knowing all historical states of the program before hand - allows us to rethink what a debugger user interface can be.\n\nThe talk will be fast paced. In addition to slides, I'll be voicing over some pre-recorded animations / videos in the style of YouTube documentaries. Demos are pre-recorded so there will be no risk of things going wrong live.",

        "description": "Django is the most extensive Python framework, which is also very opinionated and synchronous. In contrast, FastAPI emerges as a more recent, asynchronous framework.\n\nAs a developer and the maintainer of several services, one of which is a data visualization tool deployed in production across various companies, I have had the unique opportunity to use Django ORM with FastAPI. If you take a look through GitHub or other resources, you’ll notice there’s not much out there about combining Django and FastAPI — it’s a bit of an unconventional setup. The aim of my talk is to share insights from my experience with this setup, highlighting its practical implementation and the lessons learned along the way.\n\nThis talk is aimed at programmers from beginners to more experienced ones familiar with either of these frameworks. You’ll gain insights into combining asynchronous frameworks with synchronous ones, along with understanding the benefits and challenges of this approach.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/media/presentation_slides/75/2024-05-11T13%3A49%3A33.236032/pycon-us-24.pdf",

At the same time, I became very interested in the related topic of data storytelling, which focuses on the skills and hacks to make a presentation memorable and impactful. I think this combination of concepts (Python and Data Storytelling) is innovative and has not been sufficiently explored and taught. During the talk, I will share insights and suggestions on different skills and technical tools that we can use to create more engaging, entertaining, and memorable presentations using Python libraries and programs.

        "description": "NLP applications and LLMs have incredible potential to transform the way we live, work, and play. But NLP applications, especially at production scale, can be confusing. In this talk, we’ll explore how thinking of NLP applications as graphs can reduce confusion and help you build and customize quickly.\n\nWe will first look into what makes up some of the most common NLP applications today, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and how each step of these applications can be represented as a node in a graph. Then, we will see how we can incorporate branches and loops into these applications.\n\nAs a final step, we’ll see how we can build customized tooling for NLP applications in Python.\n\nWe will make use of the pipeline structure of Haystack (an open-source LLM framework in Python) as the basis for the examples. We will cover two working examples that use Haystack’s custom component API (nodes of the graph) within a full pipeline:\n\n    A private Notion question-answering app\n    A summarizer for the latest Hacker News posts\n\nKey takeaways:\n\n    It’s useful to think of NLP applications as directed (multi-)graphs\n    There are tools for Python developers to build their own tooling that slots into this architecture with the use of open-source frameworks like Haystack.",

        "description": "Dask is a library for distributed computing with Python that integrates tightly with pandas and other libraries from the PyData stack. It offers a DataFrame API that wraps pandas and thus offers an easy transition into the big data space.\n\nHistorically, Dask was the easiest choice to use (it’s just pandas) but struggled to achieve robust performance (there were many ways to accidentally perform poorly). It was great for experts, but bad for novices. Other tools (Spark, DuckDB, Polars) just did this better.\n\nFortunately, these pain points have been fixed with the following features:\n\n    A new and vastly improved shuffle algorithm\n    A logical query planning layer to improve performance and usability\n    A reduced memory footprint through a more efficient data model due to pandas 2.0\n\nWe will look into how these changes work together across pandas, Arrow, and Dask to provide a better UX and a more robust and faster system overall. Additionally, we will look into a comparison of Dask against other tools in the big data space, including Spark, Polars and DuckDB.\n\nWe will use the TPC-H benchmarks to compare these tools. We will look ahead into what the future will bring for pandas and Dask and how the logical query planning layer can be extended to fit other frameworks like Dask Array and XArray.",

        "description": "Data management systems and data scientists have a troubled relationship: Common systems such as Postgres or Spark are hard to set up and maintain, hard to transfer data into and out of, and hard to integrate into Python workflows. In response, data scientists have developed their own data wrangling tools including Pandas and Polars. These tools are more natural to use, but are limited in the amount of data they can process and the amount of automatic optimization.\n\nDuckDB is a novel database management system purpose-built to combine cutting edge data processing and dataframe-like ease of use. DuckDB integrates deeply with the Python data analytics and engineering ecosystems - its Python client has over 1.5 million downloads each month. DuckDB can read and write popular Python dataframe libraries: Pandas, Polars, and Apache Arrow. DuckDB can even query Pandas dataframes faster than Pandas itself. Beyond dataframes, reading and writing is supported for Postgres, MySQL, and SQLite databases, and across many file formats (even on cloud object storage).\n\nIn addition to the friendliest SQL dialect in the world, DuckDB provides options for using Pythonic dataframe syntax directly on top of the database engine. DuckDB includes a relational API, an experimental PySpark-compatible API, and is the default engine for the Ibis portable dataframe library.\n\nDuckDB supports complex queries, is MIT licensed, and has no external dependencies - it is a single pip install away! It is fast, easy to install and use, and handles larger than RAM datasets. Since DuckDB runs in the same process as the Python interpreter, no socket communication has to occur, making data transfer virtually instantaneous.\n\nIn our talk, we will describe DuckDB, compare it with Python dataframe libraries, and show how to combine DuckDB and dataframes for fast and easy data processing.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/media/presentation_slides/130/2024-05-13T15%3A10%3A14.306148/PyCon_US_2024_V1.pdf",

Both the Python and textile communities are also wonderfully diverse and put some very important efforts in place to encourage inclusivity, which has helped lead me to feel comfortable sharing these insights with such a large audience.
