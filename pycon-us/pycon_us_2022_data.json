She is a member of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration, the global effort to image and study the environment close to supermassive black holes. Her research centers around the collection, calibration, and imaging of millimeter-wave radio observations of supermassive black holes. Supermassive black holes generate the highest energy processes in the known Universe, ejecting jets of plasma affecting galaxy environments on large scales, but their dynamics and emission mechanisms remain shrouded in mystery. She makes use of global networks of radio-telescopes to image and study the immediate surroundings of the supermassive black holes at the centers of our Galaxy and the galaxy M87.",

        "description": "Python 3.10 was released on October 4th, bringing with it a major new feature: \"structural pattern matching\". As one of the designers of the feature and its principal implementer, my goal is to introduce you to Python's powerful, dynamic, object-oriented approach to this long-established functional programming construct, and to explore ways that you might use structural pattern matching in your own code. Along the way, we‚Äôll also dive into the history of the match statement, the design process behind it, how it actually works, and what we're already doing to improve it in Python 3.11 and beyond.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2022/media/presentation_slides/116/2022-04-29T05%3A05%3A28.862819/PyCon_US_2022_Outline.pdf",

The solution space is big, many common configurations work around the bugs and limitations that existed in past CI systems, and there are few explanations about how to do it well.\n\nA good CI configuration concentrates on giving timely and accurate feedback to the developer. Whether it is using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, or something else, there are ways to configure the system to be more accurate and faster.",

        "description": "As a large, well-established company, Bloomberg focused on C++ as its primary language several decades ago. Python began as a scripting language for writing small utilities. An intern project several years ago showed that it was possible to integrate some C++ libraries with Python, making it possible to build domain-specific applications. An engineer with an affinity for Python got approval to form a small team to provide better support for the language. Engineers also formed small committees (or Guilds) to help promote Python across the organization by advocating for users, organizing meetups, actively monitoring messaging channels to help those with questions and problems, and writing lots and lots of documentation.\n\nToday, Python is used by more than 3,000 of the company's engineers. We actively support the Python Software Foundation and open source Python projects. Python is used to train new hires on the architectural paradigms used within the company. In less than a decade, we‚Äôve gone from taking our first steps with the language to being one of the leading contributors to its evolution.\n\nSometimes success can \"just happen.\" However, most often changing a cultural dynamic takes a lot of hard work. And it is work that can be very rewarding.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2022/media/presentation_slides/79/2022-04-28T22%3A02%3A15.039467/How_to_Succeed_with_Python.pdf",

It gets harder when the original authors aren't around to explain what they were thinking. These pain points related to legacy software are often the motivation for many organizations to adopt robust open source solutions. Open source software is becoming more and more the standard in any tech stack. Knowing how to navigate the world of open source software and how to best implement it is a skill that is becoming ever more important for any software engineer. Python is one of the most popular languages when it comes to open source. In this talk, we hope to outline why this is and how you can take advantage of it in your software migrations.",

But the responsibility, time commitment, and processes that come with maintaining projects on PyPI can be overwhelming, even for the best of us. With this talk, we'll see how the right tools and automation can cut out the overhead from running open source projects, and let you focus on the fun parts!\n\nWe'll cover a wide range of topics, from packaging, metadata, and dependencies, to code quality, testing, and CI/CD, and finish with documentation, helping new developers, and reviewing contributions from the community. We'll look at high level concepts, modern best practices, and free tools available and how they make it easier than ever for new contributors to get started, while giving you confidence that their changes are safe and ready for production.\n\nRather than just pointing to cookie cutter templates, we'll talk about the \"why\" behind these best practices and how they fit into common developer workflows. We'll also include links to references and popular developer tools, as well as a companion site with slides and a list of everything mentioned in the talk.\n\nDevelopers of all experience levels are welcome. Whether you're new to packaging and need guidance for your first release, or a seasoned package maintainer looking to simplify your workflow, this talk is for you!\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2022/media/presentation_slides/104/2022-04-28T21%3A41%3A15.777027/open-source-easy-mode.pdf",

        "description": "Support for binary extensions is an exceptional advantage of Python that is too often avoided for smaller packages with low developer resources. Binary extensions are used to achieve high performance for libraries like PyTorch, MyPy, and many thousands more. Binary extensions also allow access to a wealth of existing compiled libraries. Building your own binary extension is plagued by historically poor documentation, bad common practices, and many misconceptions. But it is actually easy to write extensions today that work seamlessly on all common developer platforms using modern libraries and continuous integration.\n\nWe will take a look at packaging a binary extension from start to finish. This starts with pybind11 for C++ bindings, providing simple, header only builds and avoiding the need for a new language or pre-processor step. We will look at scikit-build for building, providing powerful CMake based builds with library search, multithreaded builds, and more. We will use PyPA's build to produce SDists. And we will use PyPA's cibuildwheel to produce binaries for all common platforms with minimal setup and simple CI code in GitHub Actions (but trivially movable to any other CI system). We will talk about how to automate common tasks, like using GitHub's Dependabot to keep cibuildwheel up-to-date while also ensuring reproducible builds.\n\nAfter this talk, it is our hope that you will no longer shy away from using compiled code in libraries, but will feel comfortable writing extensions to accelerate or advance your libraries functionality.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2022/media/presentation_slides/57/2022-04-29T06%3A17%3A37.414348/CppCon2022_Building_Python_Extensions_AP1.pdf",

        "description": "Diving into the CPython source code can feel daunting. Whether you want to start contributing or just want to get a better understanding of Python by exploring its source code, it‚Äôs often difficult to know where to start or what you‚Äôre missing.\n\nIn my talk, I will show you around the CPython source code by implementing a new operator, a pipe operator. While doing so, I will discuss core parts of the internals, such as Python‚Äôs grammar, its syntax trees, and the underlying logic that will perform the operation. By the end, you will have a good idea of the moving parts involved in core language features.\n\nI will also take you through the steps necessary to make it all work. I‚Äôll show you how I obtained a copy of the source code, regenerated the parser and token files, and how I compiled my modified version of CPython. I will also write and run tests to help me implement my changes. This should give you a mental framework that helps you while diving into more comprehensive resources, like the excellent Python Developer‚Äôs Guide.\n\nMy talk is aimed at everyone who wants to explore CPython‚Äôs internals. You don‚Äôt have to be an expert in Python, although some affinity with Python helps with understanding the internals. I will also use C to implement some of the operator logic, but knowledge of C is by no means required. In short, if you‚Äôre interested in diving into the CPython source code, this talk is for you.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2022/media/presentation_slides/71/2022-04-28T15%3A55%3A04.181398/demystifying_cpython_internals_HANDOUT.pdf",

        "description": "Rapid prototyping or development is one of the most favourite features of the Python software ecosystem. This is possible due to efficient reuse of software libraries enabled by package managers such as PyPi. While PyPI maintainers have streamlined the process of publishing and distributing a package for developers, bad actors evidently exploit this infrastructure to propagate malware. For example, simply by publishing a malicious package with a name similar to a popular package, bad actors can exploit carelessness or inexperience of developers and elevate a simple installation typo to a remote code execution attack.\n\nIn this talk, we will present technical details of our large-scale vetting system that analyzes millions of published software package versions for malware and other ‚Äúrisky‚Äù attributes, such as sudo access, source inconsistencies, abandonware, and unsafe installation hooks. We will share our experience while building this system, and present examples of new malware we have detected as case studies. Finally, we will introduce our free tool OSSIE, a Python PyPi package, for developers to audit project dependencies and notify them when dependencies turn malicious. The presented tool is extremely user friendly and is an attempt towards furthering usable security.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2022/media/presentation_slides/115/2022-04-30T23%3A12%3A58.090937/pycon22.pdf",

        "description": "There are so many tools to do data science today that it can be difficult to navigate. Many of them are AI platforms that ‚Äúdo everything by clicking on a UI‚Äù and do not leverage pre-existing tools e.g., GIT for versioning, or good old python IDE instead of Jupyter Notebooks. On the other hand, ML engineering is not classical software engineering:\n\nin addition to the code, the data should also be versioned;\nin its essence, ML engineering is an exploratory work: one can not know if the model is going to work before testing it;\nthere is no clear way to guarantee the quality of the trained model: the data-scientist has to play with it to make it ‚Äútalk‚Äù.\nIn this talk, we will build a fully customizable and complete system in python to track Machine Learning experiments. For the purpose of this talk, we will train a neural network (Tensorflow) to classify images between cat and dog, though, the main focus is on the tooling and not the ML algorithm. We will use:\n\nDVC (Data Version Control) to 1) version the data alongside the code with GIT 2) build training pipelines to orchestrate the python scripts 3) version experiments.\nStreamlit to build data exploration apps to play with the trained models.\nBoth DVC and Streamlit are open-source libraries with python APIs.\nIn the second part of the talk, we will focus on various ways of combining DVC and Streamlit. For instance, we will see how to build a Streamlit app that allows selecting any trained model tracked with DVC (provided its GIT commit), loading it, and testing it on given input images.\n\nI will provide code samples and live demos throughout the talk.",

        "description": "Over 14 years ago the first NumPy Enhancement Proposal (NEP) defined the NPY format (a binary encoding of array data and metadata) and the NPZ format (zipped bundles of NPY files). Those same formats, extended in a custom NPZ packaged with JSON metadata, can be used in Python to create a stable DataFrame storage format that can materially out-perform Parquet read / write times in a wide range of contexts. Unlike Parquet, all characteristics of a DataFrame can be encoded and all NumPy dtypes are supported. Implemented in StaticFrame, this format can take advantage of an immutable data model to memory-map full DataFrames from un-zipped directories of NPY. Given wide-spread use of Parquet files in data science workflows, a faster-than-Parquet file format can significantly reduce compute costs.\n\nI will begin this talk by introducing the challenge of serializing DataFrames, illustrating how nearly all stable encoding formats lack full support for all DataFrame characteristics. While the broadly-used Parquet format has been called a \"gold standard\" binary file format, its columnar representation will be shown to have limitations when used for encoding DataFrames.\n\nI will show how the NPY format, combined with JSON metadata, can be used to create a custom NPZ file with significant performance and compatibility advantages compared to Parquet. The details of this encoding scheme will be explained.\n\nI will close the talk by evaluating numerous read / write performance comparisons between Parquet (via Pandas) and NPZ (via StaticFrame), measured with a wide variety of DataFrame shapes and dtype compositions. I will share techniques used in implementing optimized Python routines for reading and writing NPY files, and demonstrate applications for memory-mapping complete DataFrames via the same NPY representation.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2022/media/presentation_slides/29/2022-04-29T13%3A59%3A23.738312/pycon-ariza.pdf",

When we write code to be used by Data Scientists or Machine Learning Developers we have to keep in mind constantly that every abstraction we use has to a) be compatible with a fast and easy exploration playground; b) allow for sensible checkpoints and optimizations; c) implement in a declarative fashion repeated queries and functions; and d) provide an abstraction level over all of the production code so it can be tracked and monitored seamlessly.\n\nIn this talk we will provide general guidelines to approach this problem from a software engineering perspective, defining what should our entities be, how deep should our abstraction go and how to avoid some usual design pitfalls.

        "description": "Every team implements authorization in their app to control which users can do what. You'd think by now we'd have a standard set of best practices for how to build it. And yet, we don't! Especially in the Python ecosystem. Why is authorization so hard?\n\nAuthorization is made up of three building blocks, each of which presents its own challenges:\n\n1. Enforcing authorization is hard because it needs to happen in so many places. Controllers, database mappers, routers, and user interfaces all need to enforce authorization. As a result, there are limited off-the-shelf approaches that work in all cases.\n\n2. Decision architecture is hard because you want to separate authorization from the application, but a lot of authorization data is application data too. A monolith can check its own database when it needs to make a decision, but what happens if you want to consolidate authorization into a separate service? Many off-the-shelf solutions focus on the separation ‚Äì coordinating it and keeping everything in sync is challenging too.\n\n3. Modeling authorization is hard too. It's easy to whip up the first use case ‚Äî adding a roles table to your database works for a while. But it's hard to start simple and grow into your complexity as you need it. And it's hard to make something powerful that's simple to get started with. The options available typically err on one end of the spectrum or the other.\n\nIn this talk, you'll learn the approaches for how to solve each of these areas and the associated tradeoffs.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2022/media/presentation_slides/11/2022-04-29T22%3A32%3A41.095872/deck-fa3c23.pdf",

        "description": "For many of us, writing code isn't our job - but we do it anyways. We're not software engineers, and balancing the two isn't easy, but we make do. Because with just a few lines of Python, we can automate the boring, tedious work and enable ourselves to tackle the really hard problems. This is especially true in threat intelligence, where analysts help defenders make informed decisions to protect themselves and their businesses against the security incidents happening every single day.\n\nHow do major hacks happen, who's responsible, and why? Come and learn about the world of threat intelligence, why we ask these questions, how we answer them, and - most importantly - the Python tools we've built along the way. See how we approach development on a team without any developers, balance process with productivity and enable success at scale. This one is for all the scripts out there helping us do our jobs, and for all the part-time developers who write them. Enjoy!",

        "description": "‚ÄúWorks on my machine‚Äù: The cry of developers who can‚Äôt reproduce a bug because their development environment is incompatible with their deployment environment. It‚Äôs common because setting up clean environments is slow, tedious, and error-prone.\n\nMeanwhile, debugging errors introduced by incorrect environments is slow, tedious, and error-prone.\n\nEach step in your CI workflow theoretically only has inputs or outputs, but in reality, files can be left along the way by running tests or compiling extensions. These are side-effects, not inputs for subsequent steps in your workflow, let alone deployment, but if included they can affect correctness.\n\nYou can solve this using ‚Äúhermetic environments‚Äù: running every step of your workflow inside a fresh environment, so steps run truly independently of one another. You can do this manually with Docker, but it‚Äôs difficult: you have to understand which inputs are necessary for a step, which newly generated files are meaningful outputs, and what should be discarded.\n\nPantsbuild uses hermetic builds automatically: it understands the inputs each step needs, what outputs it produces, and stores inputs and outputs inside a content-addressable database so it can rapidly build sandboxed environments for subsequent steps of your workflow.\n\nThe result is a build process where every step is run in isolation, with only the inputs each process truly needs, and only true outputs made available to each subsequent step. Pants‚Äô workflows are fast but verifiably correct ‚Äî running against incorrect inputs is not a possible failure case.\n\nIn this talk, we‚Äôll explore how Pantsbuild enables truly hermetic builds. We‚Äôll look at other approaches to sandboxing and how they compare to Pants‚Äô approach, and how you can benefit from adding hermetic builds to your project.\n\nYou‚Äôll walk away being confident that ‚Äúworks on my machine‚Äù means ‚Äúworks everywhere‚Äù.",

        "description": "In this talk, I make the case that the developer community has an opportunity to profoundly improve data privacy by shifting privacy upstream into the SDLC, where it belongs. I will share resources and lessons learned from my team's development of open-source, Python-based devtools for data privacy. Analogous to physical infrastructure, our digital infrastructure needs to be designed with trustworthiness at the forefront. As developers, we have often been left out of important design decisions about how technical systems actually process personal data. Typically, privacy risk is addressed reactively, and developers have to manually fulfill users' privacy requests across disparate data infrastructure. This reactive, burdensome approach to privacy pits trustworthiness against innovation. To build trustworthy systems at scale, we need devtools for proactive privacy, and the tools must fit within existing developer workflows.\n\nI will walk through the existing points of friction for developers today, the power of privacy embedded into the SDLC, and the tight bond between open-source and privacy. My team and I have learned that we can improve privacy at scale when the tools for privacy fit into developers' existing workflows and the infrastructure they use every day, including Snowflake warehouses, mongoDB databases, Redis session stores, and more. I will demonstrate what proactive privacy can look like for developers and data engineers: automatic flags for privacy risk in the CI pipeline, and streamlined privacy request fulfillment by traversing distributed data systems for custom data operations‚Äîsuch as deleting personal data while upholding referential integrity across databases.\n\nOpen-source and privacy go hand-in-hand in offering developers and end-users digital infrastructure that they can trust. To tackle a problem as complex as modern privacy, the solution requires all of us to build shared, transparent, and community-informed privacy standards for technology worldwide.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2022/media/presentation_slides/59/2022-05-01T18%3A53%3A23.697439/Fides-PyCon2022.pdf",

Data animations allow us to share more information and are far more engaging than static plots.\n\nIn this talk, I will discuss the importance of animation in analysis and show how to create data animations using play-by-play RFID data from the 2018 NFL season.\n\nWithin data science, we often use graphical representations of data to convey our analysis engagingly and succinctly. However, a static image does not always do justice to our findings and sometimes can miss important concepts entirely. When we introduce animation, we can show how location, statistics, etc., can change over time. Using this NFL play-by-play data, I will show how to take a static data plot and transform it into an animation using the matplotlib module.\n\nBy the end of this talk, you will know what data animation is, how it works for matplotlib using FuncAnimation(), how to animate plots successfully using defined functions in conjunction with your iterative function, and how animation can improve your analysis.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2022/media/presentation_slides/25/2022-04-29T02%3A51%3A33.350370/PyCon_3.pdf",

But it turns out that they're key to the Python language: Every time you say a.b in Python, that little dot is hiding a lot of work, from searching across multiple objects to silently rewriting things. And it turns out that what happens with attributes, while not always obvious to developers, determines a great deal of behavior in the Python language.\n\nIn this talk, I'll discuss what attributes are (and aren't), what Python does when you use a dot (.) in your code, and how you can take advantage of it. We'll talk about attribute lookup, about inheritance, and about methods vs. functions. We'll also look into properties, and how they allow us to have attributes that look like data but behave like setters and getters. Finally, we'll look at the descriptor protocol, which makes so much of Python's functionality possible, including the automatic insertion of \"self\" as the first argument in method calls.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2022/media/presentation_slides/22/2022-05-01T04%3A08%3A16.996945/Presentation__Python_attributes.key.pdf",

        "description": "Have you ever found yourself coding variations of a loop construct where fragments of the loop code were exactly the same between the variations? Or, in an attempt to factor out these common parts, you ended up with a loop construct containing a lot of conditional code for varying start, stop, or selection criteria?\n\nYou might have felt that the end result just didn't look right. Because of the duplicated parts in your code, you noticed that the code didn't conform to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. Or, after an attempt to combine the variations into a single loop, with consequently a lot of conditional code, your inner voice told you that the resulting code had become too complex and difficult to maintain.\n\nThis talk will show you a way out of this situation. It demonstrates how you can create a generator function that implements only the common parts of your loop construct. Subsequently you will learn how you can combine this generator function with distinct hand-crafted functions or building blocks from the standard library itertools module or the more-itertools package.\n\nAs an example, imagine you'd need to implement some varying functionality based on the Fibonacci sequence. This talk shows you how it would look like before and after you've refactored it into a pipeline of generators.\n\nAfter having seen this pattern, you will recognize more quickly when this kind of refactoring helps you to create more maintainable and more Pythonic code.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2022/media/presentation_slides/121/2022-04-29T17%3A23%3A39.884992/How_to_Refactor_into_Generator_Functi_eM5I4Ei.pdf",

        "description": "Trio is an asynchronous I/O framework. Unlike other async frameworks in Python, Trio offers structured concurrency: the structure of a program's concurrency tasks are reflected in its code.\n\nThe advantage of structured concurrency is that concurrent programs become easier to reason about, particularly if operations are cancelled.\n\nI reimplemented Trio-like structured concurrency in a game engine, Wasabi2D, and wrote some games with it. I found it to be an excellent fit that simplifies many game logic tasks.\n\nIn this talk I'll talk about concurrency in video games, present structured concurrency with examples found in game logic, and draw parallels between I/O based concurrency tasks and those found in video games.\n\nThe examples will also serve as a tutorial for writing games in Wasabi2D.\n\nFinally I will explore the differences between Wasabi2D and Trio's implementation of the structured concurrency concepts. By comparing the solutions we will see which elements of Trio are foundational to structured concurrency and which are specific choices for Trio's problem space.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2022/media/presentation_slides/45/2022-04-27T13%3A04%3A31.199690/Why_I_reimplemented_Trio_in_a_game_engine.pdf",

        "description": "This talk will help unlock the internal workings of a Database by breaking down the abstractions that make it. We will use Python as our weapon of choice to slowly discuss how you would\ngo about building the different components of a database.\n\n1) Talking to your Database: We start by building out an interface and a language that helps us communicate with our database. We will use Prompt toolkit to build a REPL & use a simple SQL-based language with basic regular expressions that can parse it to instruction to execute.\n\n2) Working with Data: Now that we can communicate with our database using instructions. we start the actual work in building out the Datastore, We initially store all the data in a simple in-memory dictionary and then move to persist this data to disk. We now read the data from the disk to memory every time we query the data and write back the data to the disk but this makes things very slow :(\nThis problem is our entry into the beautiful world of Indexes so by building a very basic Btree index to store references in memory to quickly access only what we require from the data on disk we can actually speed up our access times for basic row access queries from O(N) to O(1) where N is the number of rows in a table\n\n3) Future: We can now proudly demo our new and polished database that can store data, persist it, and can run queries that are quite fast thanks to our Btree Indexes. We also discuss how this Database can be improved in the future by supporting full ACID Transactions, allowing concurrency, and handling locks\n\nThe best way to understand something is to build it yourself :)",

By decoupling logic and execution, users can code in a language that they are familiar with (Python, Pandas or SQL), and then choose an execution engine to run it on (Pandas, Spark or Dask). In this talk, we cover the transform() function, which lets a user execute a single function in a distributed setting. This simple interface can be incrementally adopted and allows data practitioners to be productive with distributed computing very quickly.",

        "description": "Developing insights for problems encountered while building a high-performance microprocessor requires analyzing large amounts of data generated from a complicated design process. This is a Big Data problem. The four main challenges include: managing design components, reporting, linking data across time, and providing a reliable and scalable platform. The Design Data (DD) data model is a technological breakthrough to address the above challenges for integrated circuit design, analysis, and debug. The data model efficiently stores read-only design graph topology (e.g., inter-connected logic gates and wires), and derived analysis data (e.g., estimated signal delay and power usage) in a compressed binary file. DD is a custom domain-specific read-only binary data model with an extensive query API, which is implemented using C++, CPython, and Python method bindings.\n\nThe C++ data model implementation enables efficient graph traversal, custom interactive \"offline\" analysis, and design graph visualization. Every data file may be tagged and stored using the compressible binary format, which facilitates comparing different versions across a multi-year project. They can compare past and current data sets to identify and assess specific design trends and failure modes. This data analysis workflow powered by Python improves the quality of a chip design by allowing engineers to focus on the hard problems.\n\nThis talk will share our experience of incorporating modern Free Open-Source Software technologies into a complicated ecosystem of commercial toolchains and workflows for Electronic Design Automation (EDA). After this talk, I hope you will be inspired to experiment with integrating C or C++ and CPython bindings into your application workflow. I also hope this may help you think about different ways you might be able to integrate various methods of Data Science into your application domain.",

Sometimes, teams don‚Äôt have much control over the data in their systems under test‚Äîit‚Äôs just dropped in, and it can change arbitrarily. Other times, teams need to build their own data sets, either before testing or during testing. Inaccurate data can leave test gaps. Incorrect or stale data can break tests. Large data can consume too much time. Ugh!\n\nIn this talk, we‚Äôll cover strategies for defeating many types of test data nightmares:\n\nrecognizing the difference between product data and test case data\ndeciding when to prepare data statically beforehand or dynamically during testing\nusing data to control how tests run or reflect product state\nhard-coding values versus discovering data in the system\navoiding collisions on shared data\nThe strategies we cover can be applied to any project in any language.

        "description": "In this talk, we want to make two major points:\n\nMetrics can facilitate better conversation about code quality. They help you focus more on technical problems and improvements instead of personal preferences and organizational issues.\nMetrics can be misused very easily. Knowing their limitations is crucial.\nMETRICS\nFor each metric, we'll discuss:\n\ncode examples in Python\nhow to calculate\ninterpretation (incl. some comparison across open source Python projects)\nactions\nlimitations\nMETHOD LENGTH\nThe simple.\n\nYou can calculate it without specific tools.\nFirst step: Extract functions.\nIt shows well some general limitations of code quality metrics.\nCYCLOMATIC COMPLEXITY\nThe old.\n\nShow the formula, but don't explain it in detail. :-)\nExtract functions. Remove redundant if conditions.\nIt doesn't account for nested coding constructs. It ignores some modern language patterns.\nCOGNITIVE COMPLEXITY\nThe human.\n\nCalculation and interpretation: see https://www.sonarsource.com/docs/CognitiveComplexity.pdf\nActions: Extract functions. Use shorthand structures. More Pythonic code is also more readable.\nLimitations: It ignores both the length of a linear block and the complexity of the expressions used in it.\nWORKING MEMORY\nAnother aspect of human understanding.\n\nCalculation: see https://sourcery.ai/blog/working-memory/\nInterpretation: The 7 +/- 2 rule of the human working memory.\nActions: Extract functions, some more specific refactorings this metric rewards.\nLimitations: It ignores the structure.\nLIMITATIONS AND PITFALLS\nGENERAL\nThey can be gamed.\nThey easily encourage one-sided thinking and behaviour.\nSPECIFIC FOR CODE QUALITY METRICS\nGreat as warning signs, not good as \"proof of excellence\".\nCOMPOUND METRICS\nGiving a more versatile picture than a single metric.\n\nWHAT METRICS DON'T CAPTURE\nnaming, consistent terminology, ubiquitous language (DDD)\nproject structure\ncorrectness",

        "description": "As ML/AI systems are becoming more prevalent, the need for setting quality standards and testing practices has become crucial. Testing these models goes beyond validation metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.\n\nInstead, quality attributes like model Behaviors, Usability, and Fairness need to be tested and measured using exploratory and automated strategies.\n\nIn this talk, we'll cover some of the risks and biases that can happen throughout the MLOps pipeline, demonstrate a few techniques to test a model's behaviors and fairness, and apply them against some real-world scenarios and state-of-the-art models.\n\nBy the end, you will have new ideas and techniques that you can use to test your own ML/AI systems and approach testing these quality attributes from a user's perspective.",

        "description": "This will be a example-driven presentation. The first set of examples looks at\nan int which should be restricted to a value from one through ten.\n\nFirst I'll look at the problems in the traditional approach, passing an int\nto a function and checking to ensure it is within range.\n\nNext I'll encapsulate the int in a (regular) class OneToTen, which allows\nthe movement of the test into the constructor. Although this guarantees that\nobjects will be created correctly, such objects are mutable so they can be\nmodified to be invalid after creation.\n\nThe solution is to use @dataclass together with the frozen=True option, and\nadd a __post_init__ function to check the validity of the object once it's\nbeen initialized. Because such an object is invariant, it cannot be later\nmodified into an invalid state. This ensures that the new type can only ever\nexist as a legitimate value.\n\nNext I'll use this technique to create a Person type that is composed of\nFullName, BirthDate and EmailAddress fields, each of which validates\nitself. Finally, I'll compose BirthDate using Day, Month and Year\nfields.",

        "description": "You're all happy developing your application but when it comes the time to send it to production and have the first customers testing, you might realize that whenever a bug is found it is just too hard to understand what is going on in a production environment - you often don't have access to the user data, the user account and struggles to reproduce the error and support your customer properly.\n\nThe story is too familiar and probably happened to a lot of of us.\n\nIn this talk, we will walk through techniques and things to consider when writing an application that is going to be supported in a production environment with an eye for observability by having searchable, consistent, and rich log messages.\n\nAt first, the problem will be presented to the audience with a use-case scenario where a developer has no way of knowing what happened with a particular customer in a production environment if an API request fails.\nOpening the code for this request, we will add together the log messages that would've made it possible for the development to debug this problem properly - and then, talk through strategies to keep in mind during the early development of the code.\nWe will also walk through log levels and how to use them properly, making sure the log messages are clean and understandable, how to take take advantage of log's extra fields to have metadata about the messages that we are writing, and the best way to make log messages easily searchable.",

        "description": "A Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) is the method through which the Python community debates and adopts new features to the language. The same mechanism is used to standardize interfaces and methods used by the Python Packaging Ecosystem. The main difference is that while language PEPs are written mostly by core developers, packaging PEPs are written by members of the Python Packaging Authority (PyPA). How we build Python packages was standardized in 2016 through PEP-517 and PEP-518. Editable installs, while widely used and well known through the -e flag in pip, proved to be controversial, so it got left out of those proposals. It has taken another five years to reach a consensus, and I'm happy to say that -- through PEP-660 -- we now have a way for all build back-ends to support editable installs. Join me in this talk, where I'll tell a tale explaining how having competing PEPs and exhausting discussions -- while tiresome -- led to a better solution. Plus, you'll also understand the different options we considered and the solution we developed in the end.",

        "description": "Even though many developers (including data scientists) focus on their core problems when working on their experiments, one basic aspect can make these projects not reusable. We are not considering anything machine learning-related yet.\nOne of the first steps during the development of a project is the selection of libraries or dependencies. When someone runs pip install package-name, they might not be aware that along with the library that is going to be installed, so-called direct dependency, many other dependencies will be installed on your machine, so-called transitive dependencies. Any change in one of those dependencies can break your experiment. It‚Äôs fundamental to have a way to state all the dependencies used, including the operating system, python interpreter, and hardware used to run a certain experiment.\nIn this session, the speakers will present an open source JupyterLab extension for Python dependency management developed by the Thoth team. They will learn what resolution engine can be used (e.g. Pipenv, Thoth), the difference between these resolution engines. Moreover they will learn what to do in different scenarios emulating typical Jupyter notebook experiences to learn how to use the new extension.\nBy the end of this session, attendees will learn the importance of reproducibility, how to use the Thoth Jupyterlab extension for Python projects and the benefits of a cloud resolution engine with respect to other existing ones. They will be able to run a tutorial using only a GitHub account and a browser as it will be run in a completely open cloud environment.",

        "description": "Pyodide is a Python distribution for the browser and Node.js based on WebAssembly. It includes a port of CPython 3.9 to WebAssembly/Emscripten, and makes it possible to install and run Python packages in the browser. Pyodide comes with a robust Javascript ‚ü∫ Python foreign function interface so that you can mix these two languages in your code with minimal friction.\n\nWe will walk through simple examples of how to run Python applications in the browser with Pyodide. We will also discuss the process of porting existing Python packages, including what makes a package suitable to port and what challenges are likely to arise.\n\nSome Criteria that Determine Suitability of a Project for Porting:\n\nPurely computational projects are simple to port to run in the browser. We are missing threading and multiprocessing, so you will need to be able to run single threaded. File system code mostly works unchanged. However, much of the UI and network access are very different inside the browser. Packages with a clean divide between doing computation and doing UI will be simpler to port, the UI parts may need to be rewritten or shimmed but the pure computation need not be.",

        "description": "Preventing security vulnerabilities often brings to mind heavyweight security tools. But what if it doesn‚Äôt have to be that way? What if you could use the concepts already built into Python to make your code incrementally more secure?\n\nIn this talk, we'll see how Python types allow you to improve your project's security incrementally. First, we‚Äôll show how simple type annotations by themselves can prevent security-impacting logic errors. Second, we'll see how you can prevent injection vulnerabilities such as SQL injection using a special type in your APIs (PEP 675). Next, we demonstrate how to leverage runtime type validation to securely deal with user-controlled data (such as HTTP requests). Finally, we show how types naturally enable powerful typing-based tools like Pysa and CodeQL to perform static taint flow analysis and catch complex vulnerabilities that span multiple functions. No security tool is a panacea, however, so we‚Äôll also show you where typing and the tools that rely on it can fail.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2022/media/presentation_slides/18/2022-04-28T19%3A35%3A09.209346/PyCon_2022_-_Typing_for_Security.pdf",

With the recently increased focus on securing software systems, there has been a incredible explosion of tools, methodologies, standards, best practices, and more. Given the sheer quantity, it's hard to keep track and stay informed: how can you know what's right for you?\n\nThe same attributes that make open source software desirable to use also make it challenging to secure. When anyone can publish an open-source library, how can you decide what's safe to use? If anyone can contribute, how can you trust the maintainers? If source code and development is in public, how can we identify and respond to vulnerabilities when attackers will know about them as soon as we do?\n\nIn this talk, we'll explore new tools and best practices that you can use today as open-source software user to improve the security of your software supply chain and trust in the ecosystem. We'll show how each of these serves a different purpose, and protects you from a unique way in which your software supply chain could be vulnerable. Finally, we'll discuss upcoming and potential improvements to the entire open-source ecosystem.",

This application takes camera input in the form of an image and attempts to answer questions related to the image. Simply put, it's a Visual Question Answering (VQA) app.\n\nThe deep learning based application is built using a transformer based model called Vision Language Transformer (ViLT) which is both computationally fast and efficient, thus providing answers to users‚Äô questions within a fraction of seconds. The application is integrated with speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities to enhance accessibility.\n\nThis talk would mainly cover the following: * What is the Vision Language Transformer (ViLT) model? * Advantages of ViLT over traditional vision language pre-trained models * Best practices around modularizing the application into different services * Steps to deploy this deep learning based application on cloud (GCP) * How in-built python libraries helped in implementing and deploying such complex models (viz. ViLT) easily\n\nThe entire code is open-sourced and the talk will provide a walkthrough of the steps to build your own visual question answering application.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2022/media/presentation_slides/83/2022-04-29T03%3A09%3A38.147066/PyCon2022.pdf\n\nDemo: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2022/media/presentation_slides/83/2022-04-29T03%3A05%3A47.986467/vignet_demo.mp4",

Discutiremos las definiciones de tecnolog√≠a y sus usos en la educaci√≥n como un medio para generar conocimiento y el desarrollo de software educativo y sus etapas. Para el desarrollo de esas herramientas es fundamental pensar en las concepciones pedag√≥gicas, que van a orientar todo el proceso de desarrollo. Posteriormente se presentar√°n m√°s detalles de cada etapa de desarrollo de este tipo de software, que son la concepci√≥n, elaboraci√≥n, finalizaci√≥n y viabilidad. En cada uno de ellos tambi√©n se discutir√°n procesos y patrones de buenas pr√°cticas. Se presentar√° el software educativo que desarroll√© durante mi master, que tiene como objetivo ayudar a la alfabetizaci√≥n biling√ºe (para lengua de signos brasile√±a y portugu√©s brasile√±o escrito) de ni√±os sordos siguiendo los patrones discutidos anteriormente. Terminaremos hablando de c√≥mo la innovaci√≥n debe estar presente en este tipo de herramientas, considerando la motivaci√≥n para desarrollar estas aplicaciones y los impactos que puede tener en la educaci√≥n. Finalmente, tambi√©n discutiremos la accesibilidad y c√≥mo podr√≠a haber problemas considerando nuestros propios prejuicios como desarrolladores de software, entre otras dificultades relacionadas con el proceso de desarrollo de software con fines educativos.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2022/media/presentation_slides/128/2022-04-26T16%3A10%3A54.189378/PyCon_US_-_Charlas_2022.pdf",

        "description": "Python ha carecido durante mucho tiempo de un mecanismo de control de flujo condicional presente en muchos otros lenguajes de programaci√≥n, algo que permita tomar un valor y compararlo de manera directa y sencilla contra varias opciones. El lenguaje C y sus derivados cuentan con la instrucci√≥n switch/case. Otros lenguajes tienen un soporte m√°s sofisticado de pattern matching. Las formas tradicionales para lograr un comportamiento equivalente en Python no eran del todo elegantes. Una opci√≥n era escribir una cadena de expresiones if/elif/else. Una segunda opci√≥n era utilizar un diccionario con llaves asociadas a funciones. En general esto funciona adecuadamente, pero puede ser complicado de construir, entender y mantener.\n\nDespu√©s de varias propuestas fallidas para agregar una sintaxis tipo switch/case a Python, se acept√≥ finalmente una propuesta reciente para Python 3.10: structural pattern matching (b√∫squedas de coincidencias de patrones estructurales). Este esquema de pattern matching no solo hace posible realizar coincidencias simples de estilos de switch/case, sino que tambi√©n admite una gama m√°s amplia de casos de uso. En esta charla se mostrar√° c√≥mo aprovechar en nuestros programas esta nueva facilidad.",

This technology can be implemented in web browsers or standalone applications in a secure, open, portable, and efficient fashion. More precisely, Wasm is an intermediate language for a stack-based virtual machine that uses a just-in-time (JIT) compiler to produce native machine code. Although Wasm was primarily designed as a compilation target for languages such as C/C++ or Rust, it can be integrated with Python in interesting ways. And that‚Äôs what we‚Äôll be focusing on during this tutorial. Some experience with JavaScript and web development might come in handy but is not strictly required. At the end, we‚Äôll show how to develop a tiny compiler that has Wasm as it‚Äôs compilation target.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2022/media/presentation_slides/53/2022-05-05T23%3A36%3A12.746488/webassembly_tutorial.pdf",

        "description": "Has testing got you down? Ever spent a day writing tests, only to discover that you missed a bug because of some edge case you didn‚Äôt know about? Does it ever feel like writing tests is just a formality - that you already know your test cases will pass?\n\nProperty-based testing might be just what you need!\n\nAfter this introduction to property-based testing, you‚Äôll be comfortable with Hypothesis, a friendly but powerful property-based testing library. You‚Äôll also known how to check and enforce robust properties in your code, and will have hands-on experience finding real bugs.\n\nWhere traditional example-based tests require you to write out each exact scenario to check - for example, assert divide(3, 4) == 0.75 - property-based tests are generalised and assisted. You describe what kinds of inputs are allowed, write a test that should pass for any of them, and Hypothesis does the rest!\n\n```python\nfrom hypothesis import given, strategies as st\n\n@given(a=st.integers(), b=st.integers())\ndef test_divide(a, b):\nresult = a / b\nassert a == b * result\n```\n\nThere‚Äôs the obvious ZeroDivisionError, fixable with b = st.integers().filter(lambda b: b != 0), but there‚Äôs another bug lurking. Can you see it? Hypothesis can!\n\nAUDIENCE\nThis tutorial is for anybody who regularly writes tests in Python, and would like an easier and more effective way to do so. We assume that you are comfortable with traditional unit tests - reading, running, and writing; as well as familar with ideas like assertions. Most attendees will have heard \"given, when, then\" and \"arrange, act, assert\". You may or may not have heard of pre- and post-conditions - we will explain what \"property-based\" means without reference to Haskell or anything algebraic.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2022/media/presentation_slides/177/2022-04-26T04%3A34%3A57.242477/PBT-intro-PyCon-2022.pdf",

        "description": "Many Python developers now use type annotations to catch and fix bugs early in the coding process. This tutorial will introduce you to type annotations in Python. We‚Äôll cover basic ideas about how types work in a dynamic language like Python, and where explicit annotations can provide value. We‚Äôll then explore features of the type system in more depth, and demonstrate how they can be used to precisely yet flexibly express a huge range of programming patterns.\n\nThroughout the tutorial, you will have the chance to get your hands dirty by learning how to add types to small code snippets as well as to an example GitHub project, and run a type checker to see errors as you code. You‚Äôll get to practice and play around with each concept as we discuss it, and walk away with concrete experience adding types to and catching bugs in real code.\n\nA laptop with Python installed is required along with internet access.",

        "description": "IF IT ISN'T DOCUMENTED, IT DOESN'T EXIST.\nDocumentation can make or break a project. Getting it right takes effort, but that effort doesn't have to be painful. In this tutorial, we will take a multi-stage approach to documentation, starting with the fundamentals, adding complexity and style, then finishing with automated publishing to the web. We will practice a maintainer-friendly workflow that smooths out some of the rough edges of creating documentation.\n\nIt is never too early or too late to pick up good documentation techniques and tools. As such, this tutorial will have elements that are relevant to brand new Pythonistas (What does a good docstring look like? What is a type hint?) as well as long-time practitioners (How can I make my docs easier to maintain? Where can I host docs? How can I test examples in my docstrings?).\n\nWe will cover code comments, docstrings, and type annotations as ways to add documentation within your code. Next, we will add a user interface and documentation prose layer with JupyterBook, Jupyter Notebooks, and Markdown. After that, we will use Sphinx to build API documentation. Finally, we will automate the build and publish steps with GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages.",

        "description": "In this tutorial OOP foundations will be explored fitting signals and waves into objects.\n\nWe will follow a top-down methodology, by modelling signals from scratch, creating fatty objects, and then tweaking their representation introducing inheritance and delegation. We will talk about Python magic methods to implement processing operations. We will eventually see how to implement the Iterator Design Pattern.\n\nTrough the session, we will keep a special eye on code explicitness and simplicity, highlighting pros and cons of every implementation.\n\nA laptop with Python installed is the sole requirement.\nNeverthless, it could be handful having a Jupyter notebook instance running to visualize and listen to signals easily. In this case only numpy and matplotlib should be already installed.\n\nSlides: https://pycon-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2022/media/presentation_slides/28/2022-04-26T16%3A18%3A44.431273/pyconus22_complete.pdf",

        "description": "Everybody gets frustrated when web apps are broken, but testing them thoroughly doesn't need to be a chore. Playwright, a new open-source browser automation tool from Microsoft, makes testing web apps fun! Playwright outperforms other tools like Selenium WebDriver with a slew of nifty features like automatic waiting, mobile emulation, and network interception. Plus, with isolated browser contexts, Playwright tests can set up much faster than traditional Web UI tests.\n\nIn this tutorial, we will build a Python test automation project from the ground up. We will automate web search engine tests together step-by-step using Playwright for interactions and pytest for execution.\n\nSpecifically, we will cover:\n\n1. How to install and configure Playwright\n2. How to integrate Playwright with pytest, Python‚Äôs leading test framework\n3. How to perform interactions through page objects\n4. How to conveniently run different browsers, capture videos, and run tests in parallel\n\nBy the end of this tutorial, you'll be empowered to test modern web apps with modern web test tools. You'll also have an example project to be the foundation for your future tests. You can use Playwright to test Django apps, Flask apps, or any other kinds of apps!",
