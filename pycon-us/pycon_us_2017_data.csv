Assembling all the necessary setup for an application you’re building can often be more frustrating than writing the app itself. Learning to do this well is difficult, especially for those who are new to Python and might not know where to begin or what questions to ask. While there is no “right way” to set up a development environment or application, understanding the components involved and how they interact can empower you to customize your setup to best suit your needs. This talk will dive into what happens when setting up a database, the purpose and configuration of an isolated environment, how Python packages are installed, and finally, how each of these components interact with each other and the application itself; in particular, how an application's structure facilitates said interactions.

Modern cars are networks of computers, and a high end vehicle could have nearly 100 different computers inside. These devices control everything from the engine to the airbags. By understanding how these systems work, we can interface with vehicles to read data, perform diagnostics, and even modify operation.

In this talk, we'll discuss pyvit, the Python Vehicle Interface Toolkit. This library, combined with some open source hardware, allows developers to talk to automotive controllers from Python. 

We will begin with an introduction to automotive networks, to provide a basis for understanding the tools. Next, we will look at the tools and show the basics of using them. Finally, we'll discuss real world applications of these tools, and how they're being used in the automotive world today.

Bayesian statistics offers robust and flexible methods for data analysis that, because they are based on probability models, have the added benefit of being readily interpretable by non-statisticians. Until recently, however, the implementation of Bayesian models has been prohibitively complex for use by most analysts. But, the advent of probabilistic programming has served to abstract the complexity of Bayesian statistics, making such methods more broadly available. PyMC3 is a open-source Python module for probabilistic programming that implements several modern, computationally-intensive statistical algorithms for fitting Bayesian models, including Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and variational inference. PyMC3’s intuitive syntax is helpful for new users, and the reliance on Theano for much of the computational work has allowed developers to keep the code base simple, making it easy to extend the software to meet analytic needs. PyMC3 itself extends Python's powerful """"scientific stack"""" of development tools, which provide fast and efficient data structures, parallel processing, and interfaces for describing statistical models.

The statistician John Tukey -- who designed the box plot and coined the term """"bit"""" -- wrote:  """"An approximate answer to the right problem is worth a good deal more than an exact answer to an approximate problem"""". Python has become one of the major languages for statistical data analysis, not least because of the expressiveness of the language itself and the availability of tools like Jupyter Notebooks, which enable iterative reasoning about a problem and its solutions. 

This talks takes one step beyond an introduction to statistics with Python and aims to familiarize the audience with two concepts: a class of problems (so-called inverse problems), and a powerful statistical tool (the random walk, or more formally Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling with the Metropolis algorithm). 

In inverse problems, model parameters are estimated from observational data. Both model and data are expected to be affected by error. The objective is not only to find parameters that best describe the observations, but also to figure out how good, or how possibly bad, a solution might be. Inverse problems are extremely common in many fields and crop up each time we attempt to reconstruct a reality from sensor, radar, scattering or imaging data. 

The Metropololis-Hastings algorithm offers a solution via random sampling of a Bayesian posterior distribution. Even though listed as one of the 20th century's top 10 algorithms by the journal _Computing in Science & Engineering_, the Metropolis algorithm is easy to understand and implement, and a fun and instructive way to explore even complicated multi-variate probability distributions.

smtpd.py has been in the standard library for many years.  It's been a common tool for deploying SMTP and LMTP servers that handle email-based communication in Python, providing both basic protocol implementations and a fundamental module for higher level tools, such as lazr.smtptest for testing email clients.  Based on asyncore and asynchat, smtpd.py is showing its age, and its API is unwieldy.

Fortunately, there's a new alternative available.  aiosmtpd is a modern reinvention based on asyncio, with all the improvements that come along with such a new implementation.  It provides servers for both the SMTP and LMTP protocols, as well as a higher level """"controller"""" API for testing SMTP and LMTP clients.  It exposes a much better API for customization, allowing the user to associate a simple """"handler"""" to process incoming messages without having to worry about the details of the protocols, and it provides some useful hooks for subclassing.

This talk will describe the purpose and history of smtpd.py and aiosmtpd, show how users can extend the servers and implement specialized handlers, and show how applications can use the testing API for ensuring that their email sending applications do the right things.  Examples will be taken from GNU Mailman 3, which uses aiosmtpd extensively.

Fuzzy Searching or approximate string matching is powerful because often text data is messy. For example, shorthand and abbreviated text are common in various data sets. In addition, outputs from OCR or voice to text conversions tend to be messy or imperfect. Thus, we want to be able to make the most of our data by extrapolating as much information as possible. 

In this talk, we will explore the various approaches used in fuzzy string matching and demonstrate how they can be used as a feature in a model or a component in your python code. We will dive deep into the approaches of different algorithms such as Soundex, Trigram/n-gram search, and Levenshtein distances and what the best use cases are. We will also discuss situations where it’s important to take into account the meaning or intent of a word and demonstrate approaches for measuring semantic similarity using nltk and word2vec. Furthermore, we will demonstrate via live coding how to implement some of these fuzzy search algorithms using python and/or built-in fuzzy search functions within PostgreSQL.

This is a talk about creating pictures of a mathematical object---specifically, a 4-dimensional fractal """"dust"""" that has been the subject of mathematical research in hyperbolic geometry since the 1980s.  In the end this is accomplished using a little algebra, a little geometry, and a healthy dose of Python.

That is, I will present a case study of using Python in several aspects of a mathematical visualization project, from the computation itself, to transforming and converting data, and finally for scripting the process of generating the images.  Along the way I'll explain how Python's convenient idioms and containers (e.g. sets and set comprehensions) are a good fit for some of the algebraic and geometric questions that come up, how Scipy and Numpy enable fast numerical calculations, and how Python's strength as a language for scripting and automation allows easy orchestration of rendering of still images and frames of animations.

The mathematical visualization project we describe is a collaboration with François Guéritaud (Université de Lille).

This talk describes the build of a C Python extension, with prebuilt binaries, in 2017, where modern packaging standards, as well as Docker, have been a game changer in the Python extensions world. Most examples come from our experience building [PyMiniRacer][1], an embedded Python / JavaScript bridge used in production across hundreds of companies.

We will describe the different aspects of building a binary extension, including:

-  using the modern manylinux wheel type in order to ship a built binary, usable in most Linux distributions;
- the choices offered to developers when building an extension: the Python public C API, cffi, ...;
- testing of a binary module across various platforms;
- troubleshooting & debugging an extension: the basics you need to tackle most common issues.

When I first began working with the Python Pandas library, I was told by an experienced Python engineer: """"Pandas is fine for prototyping a bit of calculations, but it's too slow for any time-sensitive applications."""" Over multiple years of working with the Pandas library, I have realized that this was only true if not enough care is put into identifying proper ways to optimize the code's performance. This talk will review some of the most common beginner pitfalls that can cause otherwise perfectly good Pandas code to grind to a screeching halt, and walk through a set of tips and tricks to avoid them. Using a series of examples, we will review the process for identifying the elements of the code that may be causing a slowdown, and discuss a series of optimizations, ranging from good practices of input data storage and reading, to the best methods for avoiding inefficient iterations, to using the power of vectorization to optimize functions for Pandas dataframes.

Over the last several years, Python developers interested in data science and analytics have acquired a variety of tools and libraries that aim to facilitate analytical processes. Libraries such as Pandas, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Yellowbrick have made tasks such as data wrangling, statistical modeling, machine learning, and data visualization much quicker and easier. They have accomplished this by automating and abstracting away some of the more tedious, repetitive processes involved with analyzing and modeling data. 

Over the next few years, we are sure to witness the introduction of new tools that are increasingly intelligent and have the ability to automate more complex analytical processes. However, as we begin using these tools (and developing new ones), we should strongly consider the level of automation that is most appropriate for each case. Some analytical processes are technically difficult to automate, and therefore require large degrees of human steering. Others are relatively easy to automate but perhaps should not be due to the unpredictability of results or outputs requiring a level of compassionate decision-making that machines simply don’t possess. Such processes would benefit greatly from the collaboration between automated machine tasks and uniquely human ones. After all, it is often systems that utilize a combination of both human and machine intelligence that achieve better results than either could on their own. 

In this talk, we will discuss human-machine collaboration as it applies to analyzing data with Python. We will review a framework for exploratory data analysis with the goal of identifying which tasks should be automated, which tasks should not, and which tasks would benefit from a more interactive, symbiotic, and collaborative process between the human and the machine. We will explore Python libraries that we can use to build tools that allow us to perform different types of analysis. We’ll also introduce the Cultivar project, an example of a hybrid analytics tool that combines a Django framework with Javascript visualizations and Celery for task management to facilitate more efficient and effective human-machine systems for data analysis.

""""Four shalt thou not count, neither count thou two, excepting that thou
then proceed to three.""""

 Monty Python and the Holy Grail; Scene 33

Python 3 has been around for more than eight years, and much of the Python
ecosystem is now available both on Python 2 and Python 3, often using a single
code base. Nonetheless, this compatibility comes at a development cost and some
library authors are considering ending support for Python 2 . These
once-python-2-compatible libraries are at risk of being upgraded on non
compatible system and cause user (and developer) frustration.

While it may seem simple to cease support for Python 2, the challenge is not in
ending support, but doing so in a way that does not wreak havoc for users who
stay on Python 2. And that is not only a communications problem, but a
technical one : up until recently, it was impossible to tag a release as Python
3 only; today it is possible.

Like any maintainer of a widely used library, we want to ensure that users
continue to use Python 2 continue to have functioning libraries, even after
development proceeds in a way that does not support Python 2. 

One approach is to ensure easy installation of older versions if possible avoid
incompatible versions altogether. Users should not need to manually pin maximal
version dependencies across their development environments and projects if all
they want is to use the latest versions of libraries that are compatible with
their system.

Even if we did expect that of users, consider what would happen when a package
they rely on converts to be only Python 3 compatible. If they were not tracking

projects no longer work. To avert this they would need to pin those at the last
version compatible with Python 2. Users that want to use older python versions
should not have to go through so much anguish to do so. 

In order to solve this problem, and thereby make both users' and maintainers'
lives easier, we ventured into the rabbit-hole called Packaging.

Though we set off with a singular quest, our tale roves through many lands.
We'll narrate the story of our amending PEPs, our efforts in building the

errands in the """"land of no unit tests"""" otherwise known as PyPI legacy.

users upgrade their package management tools.

Did you ever need to create an application whose behavior varies with its state, while still presenting a consistent interface to its callers? A good, layered design using state machines can help avoid the tedious 'if' checks for flags, and ensure that if your code runs at all, it will run with all the required values initialized.  I will demonstrate this with examples, and talk about some available tools and libraries to build state machines in Python.      

I will also discuss how to effectively use the process of threat modeling to build secure web applications. Threat modeling is a computer security technique that helps you better understand the systems you create, identify attacks, and build defenses. I will talk about things that we, as software developers, can do to assess the security of our applications in the real world through this process.

Magic methods are a very powerful feature of Python and can open a whole new door for you. However, with great power comes great responsibility.

In this talk we explore magic method's capabilities by first designing new interfaces in a series of fun experiments. Secondly, we play with creating undeletable objects and learn about the mighty Garbage Collector in cPython and how a single magic method can overturn the fate of the object. Lastly, we create a lazy Redis client to illustrate a practical application of magic methods and learn about lazy loading.

Once you see what magic methods can bring to the table, the limit is only your imagination!

Complicated libraries can be a pain in the butt to use. It's not surprising that there are a lot of """"X for humans"""" libraries out there, some of which are mostly wrappers around more frustrating interfaces.

This is not a theoretical talk. I'll touch upon theory to give you context, but will then talk about what that means for you in practice so that you can write better libraries. I'll talk about why library UX matters, about abstraction as a general concept, about out what happens when you over/under abstract, and about some useful tips to help build friendly APIs. Meanwhile, I'll show some positive examples from libraries we know and love (flask, SQLAlchemy, Requests, etc).

Few people realize just how complicated text can be. Did you know sorting and even case-folding can depend on a user's locale? That different strings of characters can be semantically completely equivalent? That there are over a thousand Latin letters?

Legacy text encodings like ASCII made a lot of simplifying assumptions about how written languages work, and we all put up with them because it was cool to even have computers in the first place. Unicode removes many of those assumptions and provides the tools we need to write software that can just do the right thing regardless of what text users throw at it. Even if you don't translate your UI, getting the details of string comparison, sorting, and searching right can eliminate annoying surprises for you and your users.

Come learn about all of the the improvements, up to and including the re-architecture that has just landed with Python 3.6! The talk will discuss iterable views, the dictionary’s dedicated comprehension syntax, random key ordering, the special key-sharing dictionary designed to underlie object collections, and, most famously of all, the new “compact dictionary” that cuts dictionary storage substantially — and carries a fascinating side-effect.

Each new feature that the talk discusses will be motivated by considering the trade-offs inherent in hash table data structure design, and followed up with hints about how you can now use the dictionary even more effectively in your own code!

Decorators are a syntactically-pleasing way of modifying the behavior of functions in Python. However, they can be highly opaque to Python beginners. It took me a while to learn how to write one, and even after I was confident writing my own decorators, felt like they were magical. The goal of this talk is to demystify decorators by methodically stepping through how and why they work. Along the way we'll touch on closures, scopes, and how Python is compiled.

Nearly everyone (especially in the Python community) agrees that good documentation is important to the success of software projects, and yet very few projects actually have good documentation.

Often, it's _not for want of effort_ - the project's developers have worked hard on it - _nor for lack of documentation_ - the authors have produced a lot of it. 

_It simply turns out to be not very good_ - not helpful enough for the users who should be able to rely on it, and a depressing chore for the authors who have to maintain it.

The good news is that both these problems can be solved by understanding _how documentation works_, and what its different functions are. Structuring documentation according to those distinct functions helps ensure that each of them is adequately served. It also makes it far easier to write and maintain.

Using real-life examples I'll draw out the key functions of documentation, and how they map onto different ways of writing it. Putting this into practice is simple when armed with some basic guidelines. The benefits are huge, and available with a minimum of effort.

I won't be discussing documentation tools or software or other topics that have been covered amply elsewhere, but some neglected aspects of software documentation that **will make your software projects more successful**.

The software licenses are the permissions over copyrighted software. The permission and/ grant includes the grant to use, to redistribute, to prepare derivative works etc. These software licenses also set forth the limitations over these aforesaid rights. The software licenses basically marks the boundary for the usage of the code.

Therefore from the above mentioned introduction it very clear that it is very important for developers to choose the license for their code wisely and correctly.

Recently, networking vendors and Silicon Valley giants have been putting forth a concerted effort to build standardized models for networking devices. These models allow for building reusable and versatile scripts with predictable, standardized data. Without such models, the wide variety of inputs and outputs required by different devices and vendors made scripting a tedious and challenging endeavor. The modeling language in use is called YANG, and a variety of standards have emerged. A vendor agnostic standard called OpenConfig has lately become stable enough to begin programming devices with it. Using Python, YANG is surprisingly easy to work with, and extremely powerful applications can be written with basic knowledge of JSON or XML and RPCs. 

The talk will start with use-cases for programming networking devices, and will detail a specific, trivial, use case that will be used in the talk. Next, we will discuss the ‘legacy’ way of programming devices (SSH and screenscraping), and highlight the challenges, such as complex regular expressions, slow responses, and lack of reusability between devices. From there we will dive into YANG, focusing on OpenConfig models. A YANG model is essentially a template, and JSON or XML can be mapped to the YANG template. This makes it perfect for Pythonic manipulation. In the use case there will be a GET RPC returning a YANG representation of the box’s state in JSON, which we will search for the relevant health indicator by drilling down in the JSON dictionary. A simple change to the dictionary will remediate the problem, and a PATCH RPC merges the new configuration onto the box. Since open, standard models are in use, this script could be run on many devices across a network to achieve the same effect with no changes needed. We will finish up with the pros and cons of YANG before opening the talk for Q&A.

SQLAlchemy ([http://www.sqlalchemy.org](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/)) and Postgres ([https://www.postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org/)) provide several useful tools that allow us to build and query records through time: _temporal models_. Combining a need to have robust auditing, as well feature development on per-property history, we can turn “regulatory overhead” into an exciting technical challenge.

Working with time is not a trivial challenge. Python includes a native module in the standard library to work with it but datetime keeps being together with unicode a common source of errors. This often leads to the widespread of many other libraries in the attempt of easing the work of working with datetime. Datetime is one of those API that looks easy to use but given the many concepts around time, is it easy to get backfired if the developer has not solid knowledge about the them.

In this talk we will overview the main concepts about timestamps represented through datetime objects, the limitations on the standard library and some simple steps to try to avoid the common mistakes that everyone can fall into.

Naive datetimes (which the datetime API works by default with) are a great tool to represent calendar times, but when talking about timestamps (focus of this talk) timezones is n essential part of it and the datetime module can be tricky to use for that use cases.

We will also speak about different standards of time, time zones, Daylight Saving Times, leap seconds, serialization and datetime arithmetics.

The talk will be focused on giving the foundations that everyone knows to be able to understand and work efficiently and without making painful mistakes when dealing with time related algorithms.

Over the past year and a half, Dropbox has been investing in the development of mypy, a static type checker for Python, as a way to make our multimillion-line Python codebase easier to understand, navigate, and maintain.  In this talk, we will discuss the benefits of type annotations, explain how to use them, and give a peak into how mypy works behind the scenes.

Mypy is an open-source type-checker for Python which supports the PEP 484 standard for gradual typing. Originally created by Jukka Lehtosalo as part of his PhD thesis in 2013, it is now under active development by a small team at Dropbox which includes David Fisher, Greg Price, and Guido van Rossum.  It supports Python 3.2 and higher, as well as Python 2.7 (via type comments).

Python 3.6 was released in December of 2016 and it has a lot of new cool features. Some of them are quite easy for using: a developer can read, for example, about f-strings and they can start using them in their programs as soon as possible. But sometimes features are not so evident, and a new frame evaluation API is one of them.  
The new frame evaluation API was introduced to CPython in PEP 523 and it allows to specify a per-interpreter function pointer to handle the evaluation of frames. It might not be evident how to use this new feature in everyday life, but it’s quite easy to understand how to build a fast debugger based on it.  
In this talk we are going to explain how standard way of debugging in Python works and how a new frame evaluation API may be useful for creating the fast debugger. Also we will consider why such fast debugging was not possible in the previous versions of Python. If someone hasn’t made a final decision to move to Python 3.6 this talk will provide some new reasons to do it.

Lazy evaluation, also known as """"call by need"""", is an evaluation strategy where
values are produced only when needed. Lazy evaluation is the opposite of eager
evaluation, Python's normal evaluation model, where functions are executed as
seen and values are produced immediately.

In this talk we will define lazy evaluation and contrast it with eager
evaluation. We will discuss tools that exist in Python for using lazy evaluation
and show how we can build on the primitives to better represent computations. We
will introduce common vocabulary for discussing evaluation models, and compare
different systems for implementing lazy evaluation. Finally, we will discuss
optimizations that can be made to optimize lazily evaluated expressions.

Assuming that you already know how to build a monolithic app, you must be wondering how you can use all this """"microservice"""" stuff that you keep hearing about. Well, a good word of advice is that you probably don't need it. If designed properly, a monolithic app should be able to scale and fit the needs of most businesses. Even so, you should keep your development as simple as possible until you have proven and solidified your business concepts. But if you do need to grow to Internet scale, then you have a long road ahead of you.

Moving from a monolithic application to microservices is a natural evolution that is often of necessity. There are several competing schools of thought that are still being battle-tested in these early days of microservice architecture. Among all the competing paradigms, most of the requirements can be agreed upon, but are mostly differentiated by the tools used to fulfill the requirements.

This talk will cover setting up the required infrastructure, and demonstrate how to migrate a sample monolithic Django application into a microservices platform.

The demo application will use the following technologies: Django, Flask, Fabric, Terraform, Ansible, CentOS, Docker, Mesos, Consul, Nginx, Pgbouncer, Kafka

Unit, functional, and integration tests are great first steps towards improving the quality of your python project.  Ever wonder if there’s even more you can do?  Maybe you've heard of property-based testing, fuzzing, and mutation testing but you're unsure exactly how they can help you.  In this talk we’ll cover additional types of tests that can help improve the quality and robustness of your python projects: property-based testing, fuzz testing, stress testing, long term reliability testing, and mutation testing.

We’ll also go beyond just covering what these tests are.  For each of the test types above, I’ll give you real world examples from open source software that I maintain that shows you the types of bugs each test type can find.  I’ll also show you how you can integrate these tests into your Travis CI and/or Jenkins environment.

Various optimizations made Python 3.6 faster than Python 3.5. Let's see in detail what was done and how.

Python 3.6 is faster than any other Python version on many benchmarks. We will see results of the Python benchmark suite on Python 2.7, 3.5 and 3.6.

The bytecode format and instructions to call functions were redesign to run bytecode faster.

A new C calling convention, called """"fast call"""", was introduced to avoid temporary tuple and dict. The way Python parses arguments was also optimized using a new internal cache.

Operations on bytes and encodes like UTF-8 were optimized a lot thanks to a new API to create bytes objects. The API allows very efficient optimizations and reduces memory reallocations.

Some parts of asyncio were rewritten in C to speedup code up to 25%. The PyMem_Malloc() function now also uses the fast pymalloc allocator also giving tiny speedup for free.

Finally, we will see optimization projects for Python 3.7: use fast calls in more cases, speed up method calls, a cache on opcodes, a cache on global variables.

Python has a great reputation as a cross-platform language, which for many people means different varieties of Linux. But a huge number of Python users are running on Windows - a fundamentally different operating system where things do not always work the same. However, Python has always worked incredibly well across different platforms including Windows, going to great lengths to support and expose the platform without making development more complex. In this session, CPython core developer and Microsoft engineer Steve Dower will discuss some of the reasons why cross-platform support is not an accident, and how Python 3.6 makes it even easier to support both Windows and Linux.

As the applications we build are increasingly driven by text, doing data ingestion, management, loading, and preprocessing in a robust, organized, parallel, and memory-safe way can get tricky. This talk walks through the highs (a custom billion-word corpus!), the lows (segfaults, 400 errors, pesky mp3s), and the new Python libraries we built to ingest and preprocess text for machine learning.

While applications like Siri, Cortana, and Alexa may still seem like novelties, language-aware applications are rapidly becoming the new norm. Under the hood, these applications take in text data as input, parse it into composite parts, compute upon those composites, and then recombine them to deliver a meaningful and tailored end result. The best applications use language models trained on _domain-specific corpora_ (collections of related documents containing natural language) that reduce ambiguity and prediction space to make results more intelligible. Here's the catch: these corpora are huge, generally consisting of at least hundreds of gigabytes of data inside of thousands of documents, and often more!

In this talk, we'll see how working with text data is substantially different from working with numeric data, and show that ingesting a raw text corpus in a form that will support the construction of a data product is no trivial task. For instance, when dealing with a text corpus, you have to consider not only how the data comes in (e.g. respecting rate limits, terms of use, etc.), but also where to store the data and how to keep it organized. Because the data comes from the web, it's often unpredictable, containing not only text but audio files, ads, videos, and other kinds of web detritus. Since the datasets are large, you need to anticipate potential performance problems and ensure memory safety through streaming data loading and multiprocessing. Finally, in anticipation of the machine learning components, you have to establish a standardized method of transforming your raw ingested text into a corpus that's ready for computation and modeling.

In this talk, we'll explore many of the challenges we experienced along the way and introduce two Python packages that make this work a bit easier: [Baleen](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/baleen/0.3.3) and [Minke](https://github.com/bbengfort/minke). Baleen is a package for ingesting formal natural language data from the discourse of professional and amateur writers, like bloggers and news outlets, in a categorized fashion. Minke extends Baleen with a library that performs parallel data loading, preprocessing, normalization, and keyphrase extraction to support machine learning on a large-scale custom corpus.

Music is mainly an artistic act of inspired creation and is unlike some of the traditional math problems.  Music cannot be solved by a simple set of formulae. The most interesting and challenging part is producing unique music without infringing the copyright. The generated music has to sound good, and what sounds good is very subjective and varies from culture to culture.

Artificial Neural Network/Deep Learning has a wide range of applications, such as in Image processing, Natural language processing, Time series prediction, etc. But what about its usage in art? Could we use deep learning to create music? 

This talk is about how deep learning models were used to produce music - catering particularly to Bollywood.

This talk would show how an exquisite piece of art i.e. music can be generated using deep learning model which helps in automated feature extraction. In order to automate the music generation, the model must be able to remember the learned features over the longer period of time, this is achieved by a special type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) called as LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) network. 

Implementation of such complex model can be made much easier using inbuilt Python libraries such as Keras with Theano as backend. It allows for easy and fast prototyping. Packages like numpy and scipy are being used for easier mathematical computation of input vectors and for reading/writing the WAV files respectively. The neural network architecture makes use of numerous amount of music samples to train the model. After an adequate number of iterations and training time, this model generates music that is unique and original. 

In this talk, steps involved in preprocessing of data, training the model, testing the model and generating the music from the trained model will be discussed. This talk will also cover some of the challenges and tradeoffs made for algorithmic music generation.

In industrial automation _tried and tested_ always beats _latest and greatest_: The machines that make smartphones have a serial port and are configured with `.csv` files. But when your factory automates complex non-linear workflows and is jam-packed with sensors and robots, you are quickly faced with software engineering challenges that call for modern tools.

Python turns out to be surprisingly versatile in this setting, whether for prototyping a single conveyor belt or taming a building full of robots. This talk explains how to use Python for interfacing with two common industrial automation devices: a barcode scanner and a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC).

Companies with an artificial-intelligence plan have a differentiating strategy in the intelligence economy; however, implementing robust machine-learning in production is nontrivial, often requiring a close collaboration between data scientists and developers, and retooling the production stack and workflows to develop and maintain accurate models.  

Machine learning in production involves model application, handling missing data, data artifacts, and data outside of the training calibration.  A rigorous evaluation framework draws upon logging to determine characteristics of model coverage, model performance, auditing, and run-time performance.  Model coverage includes the number of times the model produced sensible output relative to number of times it is called.  Model coverage is reduced if the model does not converge or model criteria are not met.  Model performance is evaluated with a suite of metrics (accuracy, AUC, FPR, TPR, RMSE, MAPE, etc.), which assist in determining the most appropriate model to use in the production scenario and the validity of the model training.  Regularly performing manual audits for spot checks is important for debugging and ensuring the model passes sanity checks.  Model performance includes run times and profiling model pieces, ensuring performance is within specified requirements and refactoring otherwise.

In the AI renaissance, where ML is a critical piece of intelligent products, seamlessly integrating model evaluation into workflows is an important component of making robust products and building a satisfying customer experience.  Python is a great language to build intelligent products with its abundance of ML libraries and wrappers contributed as open-source software in addition to rich full-stack capabilities.

Earth imaging satellites, just like our computers, are shrinking and becoming more ubiquitous than ever before. It is now possible to obtain open satellite data on a daily if not weekly basis and for this data to be put to work; helping us better understand our planet and quickly respond to disaster situations. 

In this talk we will work through a jupyter notebook that covers the satellite data ecosystem and the python tools that can be used to sift through and analyze that data. Topics include python tools for using Open Street Maps data, the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL), and OpenCV and NumPy for image processing. This talk is intended for novice and intermediate python developers who are interested in using data science and satellite imagery for social good and fundamental scientific research.

The humble loop: it's hard to write a program without it. Whether it's processing numbers in a sequence, lines in a text file, users in a database, or any other list of things, you use loops all the time. But did you know that Python has a lot of different ways to write loops? Reaching for the right looping tool can make your code cleaner, more readable, easier to test, and it can even make it run faster! By the end of this talk, you'll be looping like a pro, and your code will be better for it.

I wrote Python for years while holding mistaken notions about the Global Interpreter Lock, and I've met others in the same boat. The GIL's effect is simply this: only one thread can execute Python code at a time, while N other threads sleep or await network I/O. Let's read CPython interpreter source and try some examples to grok the GIL, and learn to write fast and thread-safe Python.

Requests is widely acknowledged as a library that saves users an enormous amount of time, effort, and pain through its intuitive and clear API. For this reason, most people who have never looked at the code assume that its code is as intuitive, well-structured, and clear as the API.

Of course, the truth is more complex than that. Real software that deals with real problems is rarely ideal: there are edge cases, terrible hacks, and awkward workarounds for problems.

Often in the software industry we pretend that these imperfections in our software don’t exist, or we try to hide them. These imperfections frequently cause people to reinvent wheels in order to simplify the code, which has benefits for understandability but frequently has downsides for resilience. When people talk about “battle-tested” code, they mean code that has been dirtied up over time from its original Platonic ideal implementation to something that is just as complex and warty as real life.

In this talk, one of the Requests and urllib3 core maintainers lays bare all of the worst and hackiest corners of the codebases of these two libraries. The goal is to help expose all of the invisible work done in mature codebases to tolerate edge cases and misbehaviour, as well as to try to remind us all that the perfect is the enemy of the good.

Exception handling in Python can sometimes feel like a Wild West. If you have a `send_email` function, and the caller inputs an invalid email address, should it:
A) Return `None` or some other special return value,
B) Let the underlying exception it might cause bubble up,
C) Check via a regex and type checking and raise a `ValueError` immediately, or
D) Make a custom `EmailException` subclass and raise that? 

What if there is a network error while the email was sending? Or what if the function calls a helper `_format_email` that returns an integer (clearly wrong!), or raises an `TypeError` itself? Should it crash the program or prompt a retry? 

This talk will introduce the concept of an exception, explain the built-in Python exception hierarchy and the utility of custom subclasses, demonstrate try/except/finally/else syntax, and then explore different design patterns for exception control flow and their tradeoffs using examples. It will also make comparisons to error handling philosophy in other languages, like Eiffel and Go.

This tutorial is for developers who've been using Python for a while and would consider themselves at an intermediate level, but are looking for a deeper understanding of the language.  It focuses on how Python differs from other languages in subtle but important ways that are often confusing, and it demystifies a number of language features that are sometimes misunderstood.

In many ways Python is very similar to other programming languages.  However, in a few subtle ways it is quite different, and many software developers new to Python, after their initial successes, hit a plateau and have difficulty getting past it.  Others don't hit or perceive a plateau, but still find some of Python's features a little mysterious or confusing.  This tutorial will help deconstruct some common incorrect assumptions about Python.

If in your use of Python you sometimes feel like an outsider, like you're missing the inside jokes, like you have most of the puzzle pieces but they don't quite fit together yet, or like there are parts of Python you just don't get, this may be a good tutorial for you.

After completing this tutorial you'll have a deeper understanding of many Python features.  Here are some of the topics we'll cover:

- How objects are created and names are assigned to them

- Ways to modify a namespace: assignment, import, function definition and call, and class definition and instantiation.  Much of the tutorial is structured around namespaces and how they get modified to help you understand most of the differences between variables in other languages and those in Python, including

    - why Python has neither pass-by-value nor pass-by-reference function call semantics,

    - and why parameters passed to a function can sometimes be changed by it and sometimes cannot.

- Iterables, iterators, and the iterator protocol, including how to make class instances iterable

- How to use generators to make your code easier to read and understand

- Hacking classes after their definition, and creating classes without a class statement, as an exercise to better understand how they work

- Bound versus unbound methods, how they're implemented, and interesting things you can do with bound methods

- How and why you might want to create or use a partial function

- Example use-cases of functions as first-class objects

- Unpacking and packing arguments with * and ** on function call and definition

There has been uprising of probabilistic programming and Bayesian statistics. These techniques are tremendously useful, because they help us to understand, to explain, and to predict data through building a model that accounts for the data and is capable of synthesizing it. This is called the generative approach to statistical pattern recognition.

Estimating the parameters of Bayesian models has always been hard, impossibly hard actually in many cases for anyone but experts. However, recent advances in probabilistic programming have endowed us with tools to estimate models with a lot of parameters and for a lot of data. In this tutorial, we will discuss two of these tools, PyMC3 and Edward. These are black box tools, swiss army knifes for Bayesian modeling that do not require knowledge in calculus or numerical integration. This puts the power of Bayesian statistics into the hands of everyone, not only experts of the field. And, it's great that these are implemented in Python with its rich, beginner-friendly ecosystem. It means we can immediately start playing with it...

We have planned three awesome parts, spread over three awesome hours:

* First hour: Introduction to Bayesian machine learning.

* Second hour: Baby steps in PyMC3 and Edward.

* Third hour: Solve a real-world problem with PyMC3 or Edward (model, fit, criticize).

# Description

IPython and Jupyter provide tools for interactive computing that are widely
used in scientific computing, education, and data science, but can benefit any
Python developer.

You will learn how to use IPython in different ways, as:

- an interactive shell,
- a graphical console,
- a network-aware VM (Virtual machine) in GUIs,
- a web-based notebook combining code, graphics and rich HTML.

We will demonstrate how to deploy a custom environment
with Docker that not only contains multiple Python kernels but also a couple
of other languages.

# Objectives

At the end of this tutorial, attendees will have an understanding of the
overall design of Jupyter (and IPython) as a suite of applications they can use
and combine in multiple ways in the course of their development work with
Python and other programming languages. They will learn:

* Tricks from the IPython machinery that are useful in everyday development,

* What high-level applications in Jupyter, the web-based notebooks, can do and
  how these applications can be used.

* How to use IPython and Jupyter together so that they can be best used for the
  problem at hand.

# Detailed Abstract

IPython started in 2001 simply as a better interactive Python shell. Over the
last decade it has grown into a powerful set of interlocking tools that
maximize developer productivity in Python while working interactively.

Today, Jupyter consists of an IPython kernel that executes user code, provides
many features for introspection and namespace manipulation, and tools to
control this kernel either in-process or out-of-process thanks to a well
specified communications protocol implemented over ZeroMQ. This architecture
allows the core features to be accessed via a variety of clients, each
providing unique functionality tuned to a specific use case:

* An interactive, terminal-based shell with capabilities beyond the default
  Python interactive interpreter (this is the classic application opened by the
  `ipython` command that many users have worked with)

* A [web-based notebook](http://jupyter.org/) that can execute
  code and also contain rich text and figures, mathematical equations and
  arbitrary HTML. This notebook presents a document-like view with cells where
  code is executed but that can be edited in-place, reordered, mixed with
  explanatory text and figures, etc. The notebook provides an interactive
  experience that combines live code and results with literate documentation
  and the rich media that modern browsers can display:

    ![Notebook screenshot](http://jupyter.org/assets/jupyterpreview.png)

  The notebooks also allow for code in multiple languages allowing to mix Python
  with Cython, C, R and other programming languages to access features hard to obain from
  Python.

These tools also increasingly work with languages other than Python, and we
renamed the language independent frontend components to *Jupyter* in order to
make this clearer. The Python kernel we provide and the original terminal-based
shell will continue to be called *IPython*.

In this hands-on, in-depth tutorial, we will briefly describe IPython's
architecture and will then show how to use the above tools for a highly
productive workflow in Python.

The materials for this tutorial are
[available on a github repository](https://github.com/ipython/ipython-in-depth).

An overview of parallel computing techniques available from Python and hands-on experience with a variety of frameworks.

This course has two primary goals:
  1. Teach students how to reason about parallel computing
  2. Provide hands-on experience with a variety of different parallel computing frameworks

Students will walk away with both a high-level understanding of parallel problems and how to select and use an appropriate parallel computing framework for their problem.  They will get hands-on experience using tools both on their personal laptop, and on a cluster environment that will be provided for them at the tutorial.

For the first half we cover programming patterns for parallelism found across many tools, notably map, futures, and big-data collections. We investigate these common APIs by diving into a sequence of examples that require increasingly complex tools.  We learn the benefits and costs of each API and the sorts of problems where each is appropriate.

For the second half, we focus on the performance aspects of frameworks and give intuition on how to pick the right tool for the job. This includes common challenges in parallel analysis, such as communication costs, debugging parallel code, as well as deployment and setup strategies.

To do so, we will combine 4 Python-based technologies:

 - Jupyter is a real-time development environment.
 - Twisted is a powerful platform for network programming that supports many protocols, including HTTP.
 - Klein is a Twisted-based web application framework.
 - Treq is a Requests-style HTTP client based on Twisted.

By combining all of these we will guide students through _interactively prototyping_ a production quality web application that _publishes_ both _service APIs_ and web resources such as HTML, and that can _efficiently consume many back-end services_ such as 3rd-party APIs.

Django's admin is a great tool but it isn't always the easiest or friendliest to set up and customize. The ModelAdmin class has a lot of attributes and methods to understand and come to grips with. On top of these attributes, the admin's inlines, custom actions, custom media, and more mean that, really, you can do anything you need with the admin...if you can figure out how. The docs are good but leave a lot to experimentation and the code is notoriously dense.

In this tutorial, you'll learn the basics of setting up the admin so you can get your job done. Then we'll dive deeper and see how advanced features like autocomplete, Markdown editors, image editors, and others would be added to make the admin really shine.

I bet, you have encountered that name at least once in the past twelve months, either on Hacker News, Reddit, or somewhere else.  Do you want to learn more about the best container orchestration in the universe, but were afraid of the setup complexity?  Do you want to see how easy it is to run any application using containers?  Do you want to experience the joy of scaling application with a single click?  This, and a lot more will be
discussed in details.
In this tutorial, every attendee will be provided with an environment, and step by step instructions necessary to setup the environment, build and deploy a microservices based sample application.  Alternatively, a sample application of any choosing can be used throughout the entire tutorial.  All that will be performed on OpenShift, which is a Red Hat distribution of Kuberenets with some add-ons that will be described in details at the beginning of the tutorial.  To wet your appetite even more, here are some of the topics we are going to cover:

- automatic build and deployment
- git integration
- image registry integration
- scaling application
- containers security
- batch tasks

and much more.

After the session, every person will be able to play around with the accompanying code repository that was used in the tutorial, which includes detailed instructions how to run it on your own from scratch.

If you're building a web app, you probably reach for your favorite framework -- Django, Flask, Pyramid, etc. But we rarely stop to think about what these tools are doing under the hood. In this hands-on tutorial, you'll gain a deeper understanding of what frameworks are and how they work by implementing your own framework from scratch. We'll build a complete (if minimal) web framework that handles the WSGI request/response cycle, routing, controllers, templating, and a data layer. Along the way you'll gain a deeper understanding of the decisions web frameworks make, their relative merits, and inner workings.

Optimization can often help to make Python programs faster or use less memory.
Developing a strategy, establishing solid measuring and visualization techniques
as well as knowing about algorithmic basics and datastructures are the foundation
for a successful optimization. The tutorial will cover these topics.
Examples will give you a hands-on experience on how to approach efficiently.

Python is a great language. But it can be slow compared to other languages
for certain types of tasks. If applied appropriately, optimization may reduce
program runtime or memory consumption considerably. But this often comes at a
price. Optimization can be time consuming and the optimized program may be more
complicated. This, in turn, means more maintenance effort. How do you find
out if it is worthwhile to optimize your program? Where should you start?
This tutorial will help you to answer these questions. You will learn how
to find  an optimization strategy based on quantitative and objective criteria.
You will experience that one's gut feeling what to optimize is often wrong.

The solution to this problem is: „Measure, Measure, and Measure!“. You will
learn how to measure program run times as well as profile CPU and memory.
There are great tools available. You will learn how to use some of them.
Measuring is not easy because, by definition, as soon as you start to measure,
you influence your system. Keeping this impact as small as possible is
important. Therefore, we will cover different measuring techniques.

Furthermore, we will look at algorithmic improvements. You will see that the
right data structure for the job can make a big difference. Finally, you will
learn about different caching techniques.

## Software Requirements

You will need Python 2.7 or 3.5 installed on your laptop. Python 2.6 or 3.3/3.4
should also work. Python 3.x is strongly preferred.


### Jupyter Notebook

I will use a Jupyter Notebook for the tutorial because it makes a very good
teaching tool. You are welcome to use the setup you prefer, i.e editor, IDE,
REPL. If you also like to use a Jupyter Notebook, I recommend `conda` for
easy installation. Similarly to `virtualenv`, `conda` allows creating isolated
environments but allows binary installs for all platforms.

There are two ways to install `Jupyter` via `conda`:

1. Use [Minconda][10]. This is a  small install and (after you installed it)
   you can use the command  `conda` to create an environment:
  `conda create -n pycon2016 python=3.5`
   Now you can change into this environment:
   `source activate pycon2016`. The prompt should change to `(pycon2017)`.
   Now you can install IPython: `conda install Jupyter`.

2. Install [Anaconda][20] and you are ready to go if you don't mind installing
   lots of packages from the scientific field.

### Working with ``conda`` environments

After creating a new environment, the system might still work with some
stale settings. Even when the command ``which`` tells you that you are using an
executable from your environment, this might actually not be the case.
If you see strange behavior using a command line tool in your environment,
use ``hash -r`` and try again.

[10]: http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html
[20]: http://continuum.io/downloads


### Tools

You can install these with ``pip`` (in the active ``conda`` environment):

* [SnakeViz][3]
* [line_profiler][4]
* [Pympler][6]
* [memory_profiler][7]
* [pyprof2calltree][9]



#### Linux

Using the package manager of your OS should be the best option.

Today we use cryptography in almost everywhere. From surfing the web over https, to working remotely over ssh. Although most developers don't need to implement cryptography primitives, the knowledge and understanding of these building block allows them to better deploy them in their application. In modern crypto we have all the building block to develop secure application. However, we see instances of insecure code everywhere. Most of these vulnerabilities are not because of theoretic shortcomings, but due to bad implementation or a flawed protocol design. Cryptography is a delicate art where nuances matter, and failure to comprehend the subtleties of these building blocks leads to critical vulnerabilities. To add insult to injury most of the resources available are either outdated or wrong, and inarguably, using bad crypto more dangerous than not using it.

In this tutorial we look at the basic building blocks of modern cryptography. We will cover the encryption techniques, hashing mechanisms, and key devastation algorithms. Furthermore we review two of the most widely used protocol suites, SSL and PGP. We conclude by implementing a simplified version of Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), that is used for encryption of texts, e-mails, files, directories, and whole disk partitions.

Python developers use decorators and descriptors on a daily basis, but many don't understand them well enough to create (or debug) them. Decorators are widely deployed in popular Python Web frameworks. Descriptors are the key to the database mappers used with those frameworks, but under the covers they play an even more crucial role in Python as the device that turns plain functions into bound methods, setting the value of the `self` argument. This tutorial is a gentle introduction these important language features, using a test-driven presentation and exercises, and covering enhancements in Python 3.6 that make class metaprogramming easier to get right.

Decorators without closures are presented first, highlighting the difference between _run time_ and _import time_ that is crucial when meta-programming. We then get a firm grounding on closures and how they are implemented in Python, before moving to higher order function decorators and class decorators.

Coverage of descriptors starts with a close look at Python's `property` built-in function and dynamic attribute look up. We then implement some ORM-like field validation descriptors, encounter a usability problem, and leverage PEP 487 -- Simpler customisation of class creation -- to solve it. Alternative implementations using a class decorator and a metaclass will be contrasted to the PEP 487 solution.

Whether you’re building a custom web application, getting started in machine learning, or just want to try something new, everyone needs data. And while the web offers a seemingly boundless source for custom data sets, the collection of that data can present a whole host of obstacles. From ever-changing APIs to rate-limiting woes, from nightmarishly nested XML to convoluted DOM trees, working with APIs and web scraping are challenging but critically useful skills for application developers and data scientists alike. In this tutorial, we’ll introduce RESTful APIs, RSS feeds, and web scraping in order to see how different ingestion techniques impact application development. We’ll explore how and when to use Python libraries such as `feedparser`, `requests`, `beautifulsoup`, and `urllib`. And finally we will present common data collection problems and how to overcome them. 


We’ll take a hands-on, directed exercise approach combined with short presentations to engage a range of different APIs (with and without authentication), explore examples of how and why you might web scrape, and learn the ethical and legal considerations for both. To prepare attendees to create their own data ingestion scripts, the tutorial will walk through a set of examples for robust and responsible data collection and ingestion. This tutorial will conclude with a case study of [Baleen](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/baleen/0.3.3), an automated RSS ingestion service designed to construct a production-grade text corpus for NLP research and machine learning applications. Exercises will be presented both as Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts.

Unlike many introductory statistics courses, we will not be applying """"cookbook"""" methods that are easy to teach, but often inapplicable; instead, we will learn some foundational statistical methods that can be applied generally to a wide variety of problems: maximum likelihood, bootstrapping, linear regression, and other modern techniques. The tutorial will start with a short introduction on data manipulation and cleaning using [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), before proceeding on to simple concepts like fitting data to statistical distributions, and how to use Monte Carlo simulation for data analysis. Slightly more advanced topics include bootstrapping (for estimating uncertainty around estimates) and flexible linear regression methods using Bayesian methods. By using and modifying hand-coded implementations of these techniques, students will gain an understanding of how each method works. Students will come away with knowledge of how to deal with very practical statistical problems, such as how to deal with missing data, how to check a statistical model for appropriateness, and how to properly express the uncertainty in the quantities estimated by statistical methods.

*What’s the web all about anyway? How can you make your computer talk to other computers with Python?*

Modern web frameworks such as Django and Flask are immensely powerful. However, these useful tools obscure the foundations of network programming upon which they are based, which can be very helpful to understand. So instead of building useful applications with these libraries, let's experiment with sockets!

At this tutorial, a Python-flavored history of the web will be presented and attendees will write or modify a TCP chat client, a static site web server, an HTTP client, a CGI script, and a WSGI-compliant server and web application. We will learn what all those things are and how they fit together, bringing the architecture of modern web apps into better focus.

The material will be accessible to participants with no web development experience, however, they must be able to write and run Python scripts at the command-line. This tutorial might appeal to someone also attending an introductory web development tutorial, but it covers separate, complementary material. Web development experience is not required but a little exposure would be helpful; for instance, installing flask and running the minimal application on the [quickstart page](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.11/quickstart/). Similarly, prior exposure to HTML would be useful but is not necessary.

Often developers will implement APIs and then only after they’re released think about things like specifications and documentation. Instead we can make the design of the API contract an explicit part of our development process using The OpenAPI Specification (Swagger) and open source tools.

In this workshop we will:

 - Discuss the contract-first approach
 - Build and validate a simple OpenAPI Specification
 - Generate reference documentation and show how you can incorporate it with other docs
 - Run a mock server so clients can test using the API
 - Generate stub code based on the specification
 - Implement a basic working API using Flask
 - Show how you can iteratively add features and make changes
 - Discuss generating specifications for existing APIs

Participants will leave with:

 - An understanding of how to incorporate a contract-first process into their API development workflow
 - An example specification that can be used as reference for their own API design 
 - Working code for a basic API that can be used as a basis for their own development

Participants are expected to have a basic familiarity with HTTP / RESTful APIs, understanding of simple git operations, and some development experience.

Complexity Science is an approach to modeling systems using tools from discrete mathematics and computer science, including networks, cellular automata, and agent-based models.  It has applications in many areas of natural and social science.

Python is a particularly good language for exploring and implementing models of complex systems.  In this tutorial, we present material from the draft second edition of *Think Complexity*, and from a class we teach at Olin College.  We will work with random networks using NetworkX, with cellular automata using NumPy, and we will implement simple agent-based models.

With the recent advancements in machine learning algorithms and statistical techniques, and the increasing ease of implementing them in Python, it is tempting to ignore the power and necessity of exploratory data analysis (EDA), the crucial step before diving into machine learning or statistical modeling. Simply applying machine learning algorithms without a proper orientation of the dataset can lead to wasted time and spurious conclusions. EDA allows practitioners to gain intuition for the pattern of the data, identify anomalies, narrow down a set of alternative modeling approaches, devise strategies to handle missing data, and ensure correct interpretation of the results. Further, EDA can rapidly generate insights and answer many questions without requiring complex modeling.

Python is a fantastic language not only for machine learning, but also EDA. In this tutorial, we will walk through two hands-on examples of how to perform EDA using Python and discuss various EDA techniques for cross-section data, time-series data, and panel data. One example will demonstrate how to use EDA to answer questions, test business assumptions, and generate hypotheses for further analysis. The other example will focus on performing EDA to prepare for modeling.  Between these two examples, we will cover: 

* Data profiling and quality assessment
* Basic describing of the data 
* Visualizing the data including interactive visualizations 
* Identifying patterns in the data (including patterns of correlated missing data)
* Dealing with many attributes (columns) 
* Dealing with large datasets using sampling techniques
* Informing the engineering of features for future modeling 
* Identifying challenges of using the data (e.g. skewness, outliers) 
* Developing an intuition for interpreting the results of future modeling 

The intended audience for this tutorial are aspiring and practicing data scientists and analysts, or anyone who wants to be able to get insights out of data. Students must have at least an intermediate-level knowledge of Python and some familiarity with analyzing data would be beneficial. Installation of Jupyter Notebook will be required (and potentially, we will also demonstrate analysis in JupyterLab, if its development in the next few months allows). Instructions will be sent on what packages to install beforehand.

As a multi paradigm language, Python has great support for functional programming. For better or for worse, leading data libraries such as Pandas eschew the this style for object-oriented programming. This tutorial will explain how to take advantage of Python's excellent functional programming capabilities to efficiently obtain, clean, transform, and store data from disparate sources.

Microservices are receiving the buzzword treatment these days, and as such, they have a cloud of hype surrounding them that makes it hard to separate substance from fluff. In this tutorial, Miguel Grinberg starts with an introduction to this architecture, including what's great and not so great about it, and then teaches you how a traditional monolithic application written in Flask can be refactored into a modern distributed system based on microservices.
