Although numeric data is easy to work with in Python, most knowledge created by humans is actually raw, unstructured text. By learning how to transform text into data that is usable by machine learning models, you drastically increase the amount of data that your models can learn from. In this tutorial, we'll build and evaluate predictive models from real-world text using scikit-learn.

Deaf people are underrepresented in programming roles and in the wider CS community. There are extra obstacles that Deaf people face when learning to code and integrating/networking within the industry. Python might be ideal for teaching Deaf people to program, and with the help of some Deaf Aware Pythonistas, the Python community might be the ideal place for Deaf programmers to feel included.

Cilia, microscopic hairs lining nearly every cell surface in your body, play a major role in developmental and sinopulmonary health. As such, deriving quantitative properties of their motion is compelling for both clinical and research purposes. Here we demonstrate a computational pipeline built entirely in Python for analyzing ciliary motion using a variety of machine learning techniques.

C++, Java, and .NET provide sorted collections types. Wish Python did too? Look around and you'll find Pandas DataFrame indexes, Sqlite in-memory databases, even redis-py sorted set commands. The SortedContainers module was designed to fill this gap with sorted list, dict and set implementations. It's written in pure-Python but generally faster than C-extension modules. Come see how it works.

When writing systems to test if beginner programmers' code was correct, I didn't expect to need numpy, scipy a custom C module and a whole lot of cool geometry algorithms. Giving actionable feedback on tasks (in this case logo/turtle vector drawings), is necessary for the learning process and goes some fun places. Take this as a case study of writing efficient geometry number crunching in Python.

In a world where we are becoming more dependent on the network to be reliable due to trends to decouple systems into distributed services, we must do our best to expect failure to occur everywhere and anywhere. This talks aims to explore different techniques for gracefully degrading when the networks fail and the services we depend on are no longer available.

Python is a versatile language, available on a wide variety of platforms. However, when it comes to shipping code to users on those platforms, Python violates Zen Rule 13: “There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it.”: there are a lot of ways to do it, and many of them are far from obvious.  In this talk I'll show you how to build Python code into something a user can use.

As a young engineer interested in performance, much of the advice I saw on performance management focused on algorithms and rules of thumb. It’s good advice, but it doesn’t address the most common problems. This talk will cover a handful of the most common performance problems I’ve encountered in my career. We will talk about how to recognize them, what causes them, and how to resolve them.

Data Science is fun and with the PyData toolset something you can start to build with in an afternoon. Join us as we start with a few datasets, learn how to munge, model, and materialize into simple web applications for predictions. At the end of the day you will come away with a solid understanding of the PyData ecosystem and tools used everyday by data scientists.

Python is so consistent that often we can infer the behavior of new objects by assuming they work as the built-ins. The Python Data Model is the foundation of this consistent behavior. This talk presents the construction of Pythonic objects: classes that feel """"natural"""" to a Python programmer, and leverage some of the best language features by implementing key protocols of the Data Model.

Have you ever wondered about how those data scientists at Facebook and LinkedIn make friend recommendations? Or how epidemiologists track down patient zero in an outbreak? If so, then this tutorial is for you. In this upgraded version of last year's tutorial, we will explore a variety of network analysis problems, including graph construction, traversal, and statistics.

If you're learning to code, working with data is a great way to implement your new skills. However, before you can do analysis or visualization, you must have a cleaned, prepped data set. This tutorial uses Python basics to unify data sets from disparate sources. It also shows you to write your programs as modules so you can re-use them for future projects.

Ansible has become one of the most popular tools available for deploying applications and otherwise managing large numbers of servers. Its agentless nature means that the only thing you need on a server to be able to orchestrate it is SSH. This tutorial will get you started with Ansible, first by covering the concepts, and then by deploying a non-trivial application together.

This workshop will walk you through creating a basic web app using Python and Django, from ideation to deployment. Set up your first web product with a database, registration and login forms, and perhaps get on the path to a fun side-project or future startup. Tailored for designers and non-programmers and taught by a designer.

Since the SSL/TLS vulnerabilities in recent years, the landscape has improved considerably.  However, there’s still a lot of knowledge necessary to use TLS in Python properly, and a lot of useful information for setting up and debugging TLS stacks that’s hard to come by.  Join the makers of PyOpenSSL, the standard library’s ssl module, requests/urllib3, Twisted, the former maintainer of a CA, and

Machine learning can be an intimidating subject. In this session, we’ll get practical, hands-on experience with core concepts in machine learning with TensorFlow, an open source deep learning library. We’ll introduce the basics of TensorFlow, including how to ingest and prepare raw data for use, run a variety of algorithms to gain insight from the data, and have some fun with visualization.
