Security incident response is an intense, high stress, high skill job that relies heavily on human judgement. Despite that, for reasons that we can't begin to understand, a big part of an incident responder's job seems to be opening numerous browser tabs and copy-pasting bits of text from one system to another. The hard parts of incident response can't be automated, but there are entire classes of busy-work that we can eliminate with a few web hooks and some artisanal Python.

In this talk we're going to discuss how to use Python to automate security incident response team (SIRT) operations. We'll give an overview of what a typical SecOps/SIRT infrastructure looks like, how and where automation fits in, and dive into some code. We'll walk through a simple example, with screenshots and code, of automating a SecOps process. We want to show that  getting started with security automation doesn't have to be difficult or expensive (though vendors will happily take your money). Just a little bit of Python can make some great quality of life improvements for incident responders.

Floating point numbers have been given a bad rap. They're mocked, maligned, and feared; the but of every joke, the scapegoat for every rounding error.

But this stigma is not deserved. Floats are friends! Friends that have been stuck between a rock and a computationally hard place, and been forced to make some compromises along the way… but friends never the less!

In this talk we'll look at the compromises that were made while designing the floating point standard (IEEE754), how to work within those compromises to make sure that `0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3` and not `0.30000000000000004`, how and when floats can and cannot be safely used, and some interesting history around fixed point number representation.

This talk is ideal for anyone who understands (at least in principle) binary numbers, anyone who has been frustrated by `nan` or the fact that `0.3 == 0.1 + 0.2 = False`, and anyone who wants to be the life of their next party.

This talk will _not_ cover more complicated numerical methods for, ex, ensuring that algorithms are floating-point safe. Also, if you're already familiar with the significance of """"52"""" and the term """"mantissa"""", this talk might be more entertaining than it will be educational for you.

One challenge in improving diversity within a hiring pipeline is the struggle to measure what exists in the first place.

We all have to package Python based applications for various environments, starting from command line tools, to web applications. And depending on the users, it can be installed on thousands on computers or on a selected few systems. https://pypi.org is our goto place for finding any dependencies and also in most of the time we install binary wheels directly
from there, thus saving a lot time.

But, Python is also being used in many environments where security is the utter most important, and validating the dependencies of project is also very critical along with the actual project source code.  Many of noticed the recent incident where people were being able to [steal bticoins using a popular library](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/11/26/npm_repo_bitcoin_stealer/).This talk will take [SecureDrop client application](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-client) for journalists as an example project and see how we tried to tackle the similar problem. SecureDrop is an Open Source whistleblower system which is deployed over 75 news organizations all over the world. Our threat model has nation state actors as possible threats, so, security and privacy of the users of the system is a very important point of the whole project. The tools in this case are build and packaged into reproducible Debian deb packages and are installed on Qubes OS in the final end user systems.

There are two basic ways we handle Python project dependencies, for most of the development work, we use a virtualenv, and directly install the dependencies using wheels built from pypi.org. When we package the application for the end users, many times we package them using a operating system based package manager and ask the users to install using those (say RPM or Debian's deb package). In the second case, all the dependencies come as separate packages (and most of the time from the OS itself). The dependency is being handled by the OS package manager itself. That case, we can not update the dependencies fast enough if required, it depends on the packagers from the community who maintains those said packages in the distribution.

We use [dh-virtualenv](https://dh-virtualenv.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/) project to help us to use our own wheels + a virtualenv for the project to be packaged inside the debian .deb package.
This talk will go throuh [the process](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-client) of building wheels from known (based on sha256sum) source tarballs, and then having a gpg signed list of updated wheels and [a private index](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-debian-packaging/tree/master/simple) for the same. And also how we are verifying the wheels' sha256sum (and the signature of that list) during the build process.  The final output is reproducible Debian packages.

Key takeaways:

1. Set operations enable simpler and faster solutions for many tasks;
1. Python's set classes are lessons in elegant, idiomatic API design;
1. A set class is a suitable context for implementing operator overloading.

Boolean logic and set theory are closely related. In practice, we will see cases where set operations provide simple and fast declarative solutions to programming problems that otherwise require complicated and slow procedural coding.

Python's set built-ins and ABCs provide a rich and well designed API. We will consider their interfaces, and how they can inspire the creation of Pythonic APIs for your own classes.

Finally, we will discuss operator overloading — a technique that is not suitable everywhere, but certainly makes sense with sets. Taking a few operators as examples, we will study their implementation in a new `UintSet` class for integer elements. `UintSet` fully implements the `MutableSet` interface over a totally different internal representation based on a bit array instead of a hash table. Membership tests run in _O(1)_ time like the built-in sets (however, `UintSet` is currently pure Python, so YMMV). Using bit arrays allow core set operations like intersection and union to be implemented with fast bitwise operators, and provides compact storage for dense sets of integers.

Many developers struggle to find the balance between striving to improve existing code and letting good enough alone by accepting certain shortcomings. As a new developer to a team it can be difficult to understand existing strategies and patterns that are sometimes flat out bad (and often openly acknowledged as such). Often the result of tight deadlines or unclear specifications, even the best developers write code they later look back upon with shudders. So how do we decide when refactoring is worth it? Come learn strategies for refactoring with minimal impact, methods for working with bad code you can’t change, and strategies for knowing the difference between what is fixable and what is better left alone.

When machine learning models make decisions that affect people’s lives, how can you be sure those decisions are fair? When you build a machine learning product, how can you be sure your product isn't biased? What does it even mean for an algorithm to be ‘fair’? As machine learning becomes more prevalent in socially impactful domains like policing, lending, and education these questions take on a new urgency.

In this talk I’ll introduce several common metrics which measure the fairness of model predictions. Next I’ll relate these metrics to different notions of fairness and show how the context in which a model or product is used determines which metrics (if any) are applicable. To illustrate this context-dependence I'll describe a case study of anonymized real-world data. Next, I'll highlight some open source tools in the Python ecosystem which address model fairness. Finally, I'll conclude by arguing that if your job involves building these kinds models or products then it is your responsibility to think about the answers to these questions.

To combat these harmful behaviors, we have created multiple definitions of fairness to enable equity in machine learning algorithms.

While high-level security concepts may transcend languages, each language has its own sets of tools and edge cases that are worth knowing.  Python is one of many popular languages that is rarely the focus in security training, but that doesn't mean python code is automatically secure (no matter what the internet tells you).  Learn why people who say “pylint will help you with security” aren’t doing you any favours, how to use Bandit for security-focused linting and talk about other options for static analysis.  Take a deeper look at why scanning for publicly known vulnerabilities is complicated, and how to use Pyup Safety to make it easier.  We’ll also explore some language myths and best practices.

Everyone starts with the best intentions with their Python projects, """"this time it's going to be clean, simple and maintainable"""". But code evolves over time, requirements change and codebases can get messy and complicated quickly.

In this talk, you will learn how to use `wily` to measure and graph how complicated your Python code is and a series of practical techniques to simplify it. `wily` will show you which parts of your projects are becoming or have become hard to maintain and need a refactor. Once you know where the skeletons are, you will learn practical techniques for refactoring """"complex"""" code and some resources to use to take your refactoring to the next level.

Profiling involves computing a set of data about how often and how
long various parts of your program are executed. Profiling is useful
to understand what makes your program slow and how you can improve
it. After a quick review of deterministic profiling tools and
techniques, I will describe how you can do statistical profiling with
existing packages or write your own from scratch.

Statistical profiling involves occasionally sampling what your program
is doing instead of watching each line or function. A key feature of
statistical profiling is that by using a moderate sampling frequency,
you can profile your production code with almost no overhead. This lets
you find the actual bottlenecks in real use cases.

The core technical focus of the talk is python's sys module and how it
lets you easily examine a running program. I also describe some tricks
to be aware of related to threading, context switches, locks, and so on.
At the conclusion of the talk, you will hopefully understand how to use
an existing statistical profiler or write a customized version yourself.

Failure can be scary. There are real costs to a company and its users when software crashes, models are inaccurate, or when systems go down. The emotional stakes feel high-- no one wants to be responsible for a failure. We can lower the stakes by creating spaces to learn from failures, and minimize their impact. This talk introduces two ways to address failure: blameless post-mortems, to learn from an incident; and pre-mortems, to identify modes of failure upfront.

By building a simplified chaos monkey service, we will walk through how to create a good foundation for an asyncio-based service, including graceful shutdowns, proper exception handling, and testing asynchronous code. We’ll get into the hairier topics as well, covering topics like working with synchronous code, debugging and profiling, and working with threaded code.

Walk into any factory and you will see a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). It's the small box that has a memory card and an Ethernet cable on one side, and lots of colorful wires connected to the other end. Inside runs the logic that turns inputs from sensors into outputs to robots, conveyor belts and other machinery. PLCs evolved from relay banks in the 1970s and have ruled the world of industrial automation since then.

In the first half of this talk we will take a look at how they work, how to program them, and why a strange language called """"ladder logic"""" is (still) the lingua franca for programming them. In a short on-stage demo I will write some PLC code to control a device on stage.

It's 2019 now and just running a PLC isn't quite enough anymore. Everyone is talking about the """"Industrial Internet of Things"""" and they have connected their PLCs to the company network. The second half of the talk will look at how we can connect to PLCs to read data and influence the running program with Python.

Methane, the primary component of natural gas, is a 60 times more powerful climate change agent than carbon dioxide.  Current technologies for finding methane leaks in oil and gas infrastructure rely on driving well to well with a handheld camera.  At Kairos Aerospace, we have developed a plane-mounted sensor for detecting methane leaks, but the sensor is only part of the solution: getting information off the sensor and into customers’ hands required us to build an entire plane-to-report pipeline.  I’ll discuss the challenges we faced in developing a scalable, reliable, and cost-effective scientific computing platform in Python, with examples of novel solutions using Python’s extensive ecosystem of GIS, cloud computing and machine learning tools.

According to the always trustworthy Wikipedia, there are approximately 360 million native English speakers in the world. We, as developers, are so used to write code and documentation in English that we may not realize that this number only represents 4.67% of the world population. It is very useful to have a common language for the communication between developers, but this doesn’t mean that the user shouldn’t feel a little bit more comfortable when using your product. 

Translation of terms is only one step in the whole Internationalization (i18n) and Localization (l10n) process. It also entails number, date and time formatting, currency conversion, sorting, legal requirements, among other issues. This talk will go through the definition of i18n and l10n as well as show the main tools available for developers to support multiple languages and regional related preferences in their Python program. We will also see how one can enable local support for their website in Django. Finally, this presentation will discuss how we can manage Internationalization and Localization for a bigger product running in different platforms (front and back end) and how to incorporate i18n and l10n into our current development and deploy processes.

If you’ve ever `pip install`ed a Python package with C extensions on Linux, it was probably a painful experience, having to download and install development headers for libraries you’ve never even heard of. Maybe you’ve given up on pip and have switched to Conda. But it doesn’t have to be this way! The Python Packaging Authority has been working hard to solve this problem with a new distribution format for compiled Python code, called “wheels.”

In this talk, we’ll descend into the practice of PEPs 513 and 571: arcane scrolls that can equip Python developers with spells to pre-compile applications and libraries in a way that allows most Linux end users to run them directly. I’ll show you how to hex compiled artifacts and source code into the wheel format, harness application binary interfaces (ABIs) to use external libraries, brave the eldritch horrors of the dynamic linker, and bind these all together in the manylinux environment. Come learn to harness the black magic of Python wheels, and you too can spare your users pain… for a price.

Python makes it incredibly easy to build programs that do what you want. But what happens when you want to do what you want, but with more input? One of the easiest things to do is to make a program concurrent so that you can get more performance on large data sets. But what's involved with that?

Right now, there are any number of ways to do this, and that can be confusing! How does `asyncio` work? What's the difference between a thread and a process? And what's this Hadoop thing everyone keeps talking about?

In this talk, we'll cover some broad ground of what the different concurrency models available to you as a Python developer are, the tradeoffs and advantages of each, and explain how you can select the right one for your purpose.

Serverless computing is all about paying only for what you use: it can scale up to handle millions of requests, but it can also scale down to 0, costing you nothing if your application is not receiving any traffic.

Serverless tends to get expensive when databases are involved.... but if your data is static or changes infrequently, you can use serverless tools to provide powerful interactive APIs extremely cheaply.

[Datasette](https://datasette.readthedocs.io/) is an open-source Python tool that provides an instant, read-only JSON API for any SQLite database. It also provides tools for packaging the database up as a Docker container and instantly deploying that container to a number of different serverless hosting platforms.

This makes it a powerful tool for sharing interesting data online, in a way that allows users to both explore that data themselves and build their own interpretations of the data using the Datasette JSON API.

In this session I'll show you how to use Datasette to publish data, and illustrate examples of the exciting things people have already built using the tool - including a number of real-world data journalism projects.

I'll also teach people how to use some of the other tools in the Datasette ecosystem:

* [Datasette Publish](https://publish.datasettes.com/), which allows CSV data to be published using Datasette to a serverless hosting account owned by the user, without any engineering experience required.
* [csvs-to-sqlite](https://pypi.org/project/csvs-to-sqlite/), a tool for efficiently converting large numbers of CSV files into a Datasette-compatible SQLite database.
* [sqlite-utils](https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/), a library that lets users create complex databases from custom data feeds in just a few lines of Python code (ideal for working with Jupyter notebooks).

I'll discuss the philosophy and design behind Datasette, including how immutable SQLite databases make for an impressively scalable solution for inexpensively serving complex data on the internet. Finally, I'll be exploring how Datasette takes advantage of Python 3 asyncio and the new ASGI specification.

Type checking is helping find bugs, making code easier to under stand, enabling refactors, and is an important aid to our ongoing Python 3 migration.

Additionally, we’ll discuss the performance problems we faced as the size of our checked codebase grew, and the techniques we employed to allow mypy—which is implemented in Python—to efficiently check (faster than a second, for most incremental checks) millions of lines of code, which culminated in mypyc, a new ahead-of-time compiler for type-annotated Python!

It’s 2019, and Moore’s Law is dead. CPU performance is plateauing, but GPUs provide a chance for continued hardware performance gains, if you can structure your programs to make good use of them.

CUDA is a platform developed by Nvidia for GPGPU--general purpose computing with GPUs. It backs some of the most popular deep learning libraries, like Tensorflow and Pytorch, but has broader uses in data analysis, data science, and machine learning. 

There are several ways that you can start taking advantage of CUDA in your Python programs. 

For some common Python libraries, there are drop-in replacements that let you start running computations on the GPU while still using familiar APIs. For example, CuPy provides a NumPy-like API for interacting with multi-dimensional arrays. Similarly, cuDF is a recent project that mimics the pandas interface for dataframes.

If you want more control over your use of CUDA APIs, you can use the PyCUDA library, which provides bindings for the CUDA API that you can call from your Python code. Compared with drop-in libraries, it gives you the ability to manually allocate memory on the GPU, and write custom CUDA functions (called kernels). However, its drawbacks include writing your CUDA code as large strings in Python, and compiling your CUDA code at runtime.

Finally, for the best performance you can use the Python C/C++ extension interface, the approach taken by deep learning libraries like Pytorch. One of the strengths of Python is the ability to drop down into C/C++, and libraries like NumPy take advantage of this for increased speed. If you use Nvidia’s nvcc compiler for CUDA, you can use the same extension interface to write custom CUDA kernels, and then call them from your Python code.

This talk will explore each of these methods, provide examples to get started, and discuss in more detail the pros and cons of each approach.

Type hinting for Python (as a linter tool) came out in September 2015 as part of Python 3.5 (and was championed by Guido himself). Since then, variable annotations (plus, more recently, protocols) improved its capabilities even further. Over the last two years, tools, such as mypy, could build on top of it. Slowly, these annotations have emerged from a proof of concept state (e.g., mypy API planning) to becoming a stable feature.

In this presentation, I'll tell my story of using type hints for both adding type hinting and checking type correctness for a library supporting both Python 2 and 3 and reusing this information to insert type data into the generated Sphinx documentation automatically.

The admin interface that comes built-in with Django is one of the most-loved (and oft-abused) features.  However, early converts are often disappointed to find that the admin doesn't seem to be scaling as their database grows in size, forcing them (so they think) to switch to a custom interface much sooner than they would prefer.

However, many common performance issues can be fixed with a few small configuration changes that are much easier than a rewrite!

In this talk, we'll use an example project to demonstrate the most common performance pitfalls encountered when using the Django admin, and fix them - live!  We'll use django-debug-toolbar, a powerful debugging interface that everyone who uses Django should be familiar with, to identify our issues and confirm that they are fixed.

Every programmer should learn to use solvers, tools that reason directly from a description of a problem to its solution.  

Tools like AlphaZero can formulate winning strategies for games given only a description of the rules of the game.  For certain classes of problems, we really can just let the computer do the work.

In this talk, we learn principles, techniques, and multiple examples for three solvers available in Python.

The first tool is a generic puzzle-solving framework that employs tree search strategies.  We apply it to a simple sequencing problem and then to a harder sliding-block puzzle. Next, we'll look at the solver code to learn how it works.  I'll also show an essential optimization technique and how to humanize the output.  We demonstrate our skills by solving another famous puzzle.

The second tool is called a SAT solver. It is one of the miracles of the 21st century. From first principles, I'll show you what problems it solves and the way problems need to be described for modules like *PycoSAT*.  I'll provide helper functions to humanize our interactions with this great tool.  Then, we'll demonstrate our skills by creating a Sudoku solver and a readable logic problem solver.

The third tool is the """"multi-armed bandit"""". It is a generic reinforcement learning algorithm that is easy to learn, powerful, and applicable to a broad class of problems.  We apply it to winning rock-paper-scissors using pattern recognition.

Lastly, I'll summarize DeepMind's paper on AlphaZero which was published in the December 2018 edition of *Science*.  This gives us hints at the full potential of these techniques.  

Pure Python source code and examples are provided for all of the tools.

Application security remains a long-term and high-stakes problem for most projects that interact with external users. Python's type system is already widely used for readability, refactoring, and bug detection — this talk will demonstrate how types can also be leveraged to make your project systematically more secure. We'll investigate (1) how static type checkers like Pyre or MyPy can be extended with simple library modifications to catch vulnerable patterns, and (2) how deeper type-based static analysis can reliably flag remaining use cases to security engineers. As an example, I'll focus on a basic security problem and how you might use both tools in combination, drawing from our experience deploying these methods to build more secure applications at Facebook and Instagram.

Inheritance is among the first concepts we learn when studying object-oriented programming. But inheritance comes with some unhappy strings attached. Inheritance, by its very nature, tends to bind a subclass to its superclass. This means that modifying the behavior of a superclass might alter the behavior of all its subclasses, sometimes in unanticipated ways. Furthermore, it’s commonly accepted that inheritance actually breaks encapsulation. So, if inheritance has these issues, what alternative do we have? More than two decades ago, The Gang of Four (Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides) suggested in their famous _Design Patterns_ book  that we should favor object composition over class inheritance.

In this talk I will show some code examples in Python where inheritance goes astray and demonstrate how to correct them by using composition. My intention is not to demonize inheritance, but instead present how to use it wisely in order to improve the design of our object-oriented software so that it’s more flexible and easier to maintain.

Bayesian A/B testing has gained much popularity over the years. It seems, however, that the examples stop at two groups. This begs the questions: should we not be able to do more than simple two-group, case/control comparisons?

Python is known for its """"batteries included"""" philosophy but no Python developer can live without the language's rich library ecosystem. Unfortunately, as the number of libraries increases, so does the risk of cross-library incompatibilities, or """"dependency hell"""".

Dependency hell arises when two libraries have mutually conflicting requirements. These can be very difficult for developers to diagnose and may not be fixable without avoiding certain libraries entirely.

At Dropbox, we’ve always used Python to power our application for Windows, macOS and Linux (until recently, Python 2.7). Over the years, a growing lack of features and the need for outdated compilers/toolchains made migrating to Python 3 a necessity. Join us to hear the tale of our unique journey from Python 2 to 3 and the lessons we learned along the way:

- We’ll discuss the reasons that led to our decision to make the jump.
- We’ll dive into how we sequenced the transition by using the C-API to ship both versions of Python and choose one at runtime.
- We’ll reveal the tools we used to enforce a hybrid (2/3) syntax for over hundreds of thousands of lines of Python code.
- We’ll discuss some of our most spectacular bugs and gotchas, and how you can avoid them!

The CPython project is now 28 years old. It has active core developers, but almost all of them are volunteers. It's difficult to ask someone to be committed into a project for 5 years without being paid. Helping newcomers and mentoring contributors takes time and few developers are available for that. We are working on improving the diversity of CPython core developers and get more active core developers, but it's a slow process.

We will cover how we used Python to adapt to a large institutional processing setup.  We used Python to create the definitions, configuration files, and supplementary metadata for each of the weather radars we worked with.  We used a variety of custom tools to interface with existing systems and processes that would have been infeasible to work with otherwise.

We took advantage of one of Python’s greatest strengths: its flexibility.  We used it to perform the bulk of our data processing with NumPy, created custom utility functions to encourage code reuse, and created custom scripts for interfacing with the institutional data processing framework we worked within.

Decorators are one of Python's most powerful features.  But even if you understand what they do, it's not always obvious what you can do with them.  Sure, from a practical perspective, they let you remove repeated code from your callables.  And semantically, they let you think at a higher level of abstraction, applying the same treatment to functions and classes.

But what can you actually do with them?  For many Python developers I've encountered, ecorators sometimes appear to be a solution looking for a problem.

In this talk, I'll show you some practical uses for decorators, and how you can use them to make your code more readable and maintainable, while also providing more semantic power.  Moreover, you'll see examples of things would be hard to do without decorators.  I hope that after this talk, you'll have a good sense of how to use decorators in your own Python projects.

Mocking and patching are powerful techniques for testing, but they can be easily abused, with negative effects on code quality, maintenance, and application architecture.  These pain-points can be hard to verbalize, and consequently hard to address.  If your unit tests are a PITA, but you cannot explain why, this talk may be for you.

Mocking as a technique has deep roots within OOD and TDD, going back 20+ years, but many Python developers know mocks and patches merely as a technique to isolate code under test.  In the absence of knowledge around OOD and TDD, best practices around mocking are completely unknown, misunderstood, or ignored.   Developers who use mocks and patches without doing TDD or OOD are susceptible to falling into many well-understood and documented traps.

This talk will draw a historical connection between the way mocks are taught today, and their origins in TDD, OOD, and Java.  It will also demonstrate some pitfalls, and provide some guidance and alternatives to mocking and patching (e.g., dependency injection, test doubles, functional style).

If we knew all of the bugs we needed to write tests for, wouldn't we just... not write the bugs?  So how can testing find bugs that nobody would think of?

The answer is to have a computer *write your tests for you!*  You declare what kind of input should work - from 'an integer' to 'matching this regex' to 'this Django model' and write a test which should always pass... then Hypothesis searches for the smallest inputs that cause an error.

If you’ve ever written tests that didn't find all your bugs, this talk is for you.  We'll cover the theory of property-based testing, a worked example, and then jump into a whirlwind tour of the library: how to use, define, compose, and infer strategies for input; properties and testing tactics for your code; and how to debug your tests if everything seems to go wrong.

Starting a few years ago, Capital One has committed to go all-in on public cloud and open source software for many of our core business operations, processes, and machine learning models. To support this transformation, we embarked on a multi-year journey to build a Python community with critical mass of users, and scale adoption of Python in our business analyst and data analyst workforces.

Python has been envisioned since its early days as a programming language which can be used to """"create better, easier to use tools for program development and analysis"""", as well as """"build a user community around all of the above, encouraging feedback and self-help"""". [1] In our experience scaling Python adoption amongst analyst communities within a Fortune 500 company, we have found the aforementioned visions true to form - not only is Python a great first programming language for our analysts to learn, it also comes with """"batteries included"""" and contains many of the data-related tools and libraries which allows our analysts to get productive very quickly.

This talk will highlight our multi-pronged approaches to overcome organizational inertia to build a community of Python users, provide Python and OSS training, and encourage Python adoption (with mixed success). We'll share what (we think) best practices are out there, and lessons learned along the way.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feature flags can be powerful tools in mitigating risk in your development cycle — _if you use them correctly_. Failing to do so can have enormous consequences for yourself and your business. In 2012 one improperly deployed feature flag sent a $365 million company into bankruptcy in 45 minutes. So let’s talk about feature flags, specifically in how they can help us with intentional deployment. Feature flags give us a high degree of control over the features we release — but what ensures we have a high degree of control over our feature flags? 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this talk, I’ll go over the best practices which will make your feature flagging program a success. The humble Feature Flag can transform into many different things: release toggle, experiment, kill switch, permissioning and more. I’ll talk briefly about the possibilities Feature Flags open up, and then describe how to use best practices of visibility and accountability to align those different flags into a cohesive feature flagging system.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this talk, you’ll know what best practices make a successful feature flagging program, and be able to implement them into your current solution to deploy faster and with less risk.

One of the reasons why programming in Python is very straightforward and simple is that we do not have to worry about the lifetime of our objects. That is, once it ceases to be necessary, a variable disappears from the memory """"magically"""". The fact that this happens automatically can erroneously lead us to believe that it is not required to worry about what happens behind the scenes.

Nothing is further from reality: knowing how Python manages memory is fundamental in specific scenarios, and not knowing what is happening can have consequences as significant as unpleasant. For example, if our programs manage a large amount of data at the same time or launch multiple processes in parallel, this ceases to be a theoretical issue and becomes something that we, logical minds, also care.

Although these concepts tend to be considered advanced and difficult to understand, we will see that this is not the case. This topic is not a purely theoretical matter nor is it difficult to find its practical applications. In this talk, we will explain why it is something that should matter to us, and we will talk about how to apply the knowledge we have gained to specific problems.

Data Science and Machine learning have been synonymous with languages like Python.
Libraries like Numpy and Pandas have become the de facto standard when working with data.
The DataFrame object provided by Pandas gives us the ability to work with heterogeneous unstructured data that is commonly used in """"real world"""" data.

New learners are often drawn to Python and Pandas because of all the different and exciting types of models
and insights the language can do and provide,
but are awestruck when faced with the initial learning curve.

This tutorial aims to guide the learner from using spreadsheets to using the Pandas DataFrame.
Not only does moving to a programming language allow the user to have a more reproducible workflow,
but as datasets get larger, some cannot even be opened in a spreadsheet program.
The goal is to have an absolute beginner proficient enough with Pandas that they can start working with data in Python.

We will cover how to load and view our data
and introduce what Dr. Hadley Wickham has coined """"tidy data"""".
Tidy data is an important concept because the process of tidying data will fix a host of data problems
that are needed to perform analytics.
We then cover functions and applying methods to our data with a focus on data cleaning,
and how we can use the concept of split-apply-combine (groupby) to summarize or reduce our data.

Finally, we cover the role of Pandas in analysis packages such as scikit learn.
The tutorial will end with a fitted model.

Have you ever thought about what open source software or hardware could achieve? What if it could help improve people's lives by solving some of their health problems?

After the medical tech industry kept promising a system to help automatically manage insulin for type 1 diabetic people and never delivering, some people got together to find ways to do it with the tech they already had. Over the past few years, a """"closed-loop"""" system has been developed to algorithmically regulate people's blood sugars. After reverse engineering bluetooth sensors and 915 MHz insulin pumps, the system became possible. As a diabetic, I also built this system and saw my sugar values stabilize much more than I could ever achieve doing it manually myself. Now I'm working on contributing back to the projects as well.

I want to talk about this system, from a technical side as well as a personal side. I'll talk about OpenAPS (the open artificial pancreas system) and how it works, what problems it solves, and its safety and security concerns. I also want to show how it's helped me, and what this means for my health now and in the future. I ultimately want to show how we, as software developers, can change people's lives through the code we write.

Observability is often thought of as just a new word for monitoring. While it encompasses traditional devops areas such as monitoring, metrics, and infrastructure management, it’s much deeper and empowers developers at all levels of the stack. **Observability is about achieving a deep understanding of your software**. This not only helps you localize and debug production issues but removes uncertainty and speculation, **empowering developers** to know their tools and improving engineering excellence. Observability helps developers “understand the narrative” of what’s going on in their software.

This talk is about how we’ve driven adoption of a culture of observability within our engineering culture. We'll define and motivate for our focus on observability; discuss the tangible tools we’ve built and best practices we’ve adopted to ingrain observability into our engineering culture; and provide some specific, real-world results we’ve achieved as part of this effort. We'll will focus particularly on the tooling we’ve adopted around Django and Celery  and some interesting experiences we had extending their internals.

Embroidery is a technology that dates back centuries and is still popular in the present day among craftspeople around the world. Cross-stitch refers to the creation of crosses in a grid that combines to build up an image, based on a 'chart' or pattern of the intended design.

Even though entire pieces could be created based on completely manual processes, much of the technology behind automating chart creation is locked behind paid software. 

During this presentation, we will discuss how we can leverage the Python Imaging Library (PIL, now Pillow) in order to take source images and turn them into cross-stitch charts.

Object Relational Mappers (ORMs) are awesome enhancers of developer productivity. The freedom of having the library write that SQL and give you back a useful, rich model instance (or a bunch of them) instead of just a tuple or a list of records is simply amazing.

But if you forget you have an actual database behind all that convenience, then it'll bite you back, usually when you've been in production for a while, after you've accumulated enough data that your once speedy application starts slowing down do a crawl.

Databases work best when you ask them once for (or to do) a bunch of stuff, instead of asking them lots of times for small stuff.

We'll discuss how innocent looking attribute accesses on your model instances translate to sequential queries (the infamous [N+1 problem][1]).

Then we'll go through some practical solutions, taken from real cases that resulted in massive speed ups. We'll cover how changes in Python code resulted in changes to the resulting SQL Queries

Solutions not only for queries, but also inserts and updates, which tend to be less well documented.

Though this talk focuses on SQLAlchemy, the lessons should be applicable to most ORMs in most programing languages. The ideas discussed, and solutions proposed are also valid for any storage backend, not only SQL databases.

How we teach, rather than what we teach, often has the most impact on who participates and on learning outcomes. This presentation covers trends in computational teaching, and focuses on how these trends relate to diversity, inclusion, equity, and access to computational training. Through the lens of The Carpentries, an organization dedicated to teaching foundational coding and data science skills worldwide, we present best practices and opportunities for improvement in computational teaching pedagogy. Evidence-based teaching practices, “train-the-trainer” programs, and mentoring are three strategies we outline that support inclusive pedagogy in computational teaching. We describe and discuss effective teaching practices that promote inclusive pedagogy in computational teaching, including formative assessment, collaborative note taking, a strong commitment to a Code of Conduct, and creating a welcoming environment for learners.

I have been teaching undergraduate computational physics for more than a decade in my university. Adopting Python as our programming language has really helped because of its unique qualities which made it easily accessible and easy to teach/learn. However, providing enough computing devices to the increasing number of students has been a serious challenge. This is even more frustrating when one require to involve online classroom submission/evaluation of assignments. I have overcome this challenge by adopting QPython in smartphones which are rapidly penetrating Africa. With a built-in math library and possibility to install Numpy, QPython in smartphones has made the teaching/learning to more students more efficient especially as they can now engage in learning programming anywhere, anytime and anyhow. The success made me extend it to one of our current projects under the Python African Computational Science and Engineering Tour (PACSETPro) on teaching Python to students, new beginners as well as expert programmers in science and engineering (S & E).   In this talk, I gave a captivating account on how to use QPython to teach computational approaches in S & E in a manner that advancing to normal computing systems is straightforward. Highly excited by the success so far, our outlook is having both Matplotlib  and QVPython in smartphones.

We will share methods to increase student engagement and aid the transition to Python. We used “Unplugged” activities that complement programming fundamentals, “block-based” logic in Scratch, and the drag-to-text Python platform in Codesters. We will also share examples of leading discussions that build girls’ curiosity about technology fields, including learning about role models of top women in the industry, and learning about emerging areas in technology.

Additionally, organizing clubs for students from diverse backgrounds, with varying technical educations, can involve bridging gaps and encouraging community involvement. We’ll discuss methods of reaching families and local communities, such as open presentations, celebrations, and share some do's and don'ts from our experiences. We’ll also share ways to encourage participants to develop communication skills about their technical work and teamwork.

Natural language processing (NLP) has experienced a rapid growth over the last few years and has become an important skill to build applications that range from social features to clinical and health solutions. In this tutorial, we will introduce PyTorch as a tool to build and experiment with various modern NLP techniques by building deep learning architectures based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and bidirectional long short-term memory networks (biLSTMs).

We will cover a wide range of topics with the purpose of providing participants with enough fundamental knowledge and skills to be able to apply modern NLP to real-world problems using PyTorch. Some concepts and topics include but not limited to data loaders, vectorization, computation graphs, sentiment analysis, fine-grained emotion classification, and neural machine translation.

Nowadays, it is just not enough to arbitrarily train a model and deploy it for production use without properly debugging it. This tutorial also aims to provide hands-on examples and well-organized exercises that teach students how to properly test, train and evaluate NLP models using best practices. Once models are properly trained and evaluated they will be efficiently transformed, stored, and then restored to obtain inferences from real-world, natural language data.

XSS, SQL Injections and Improper Authorization, oh my!  Between the OWASP Top 10, CSRF, stealing sessions, and DDOS attacks, have you ever felt that the world of web security was too complex to understand?  Do you find yourself wishing that you understood what those acronyms *really* translate to in a live web application?

If so, then this is the tutorial you've been waiting for.  In this tutorial, we'll cover essential topics in web security, including the majority of the OWASP Top 10, but we *won't* be doing it in a theoretical manner.  We'll take a live, deliberately insecure web application, identify the vulnerabilities, exploit them, and finally fix them.  Sound cool?  It is!

Topics include the following:

* Cross-site scripting (XSS)
* Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
* Cookies and how they can be abused
* Why default passwords are dangerous
* Improper authorization checking
* Incorrect Session Management
* SQL Injection
* How to abuse Pickle
* And more!

You'll also learn next steps and we'll provide suggested resources for continuing your security education.

While previous experience with Django is not required, it is recommended.  You should have an understanding of how web applications work in general and have completed the official [Django Tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/intro/tutorial01/) or something substantially similar.

Optimization can often help to make Python programs faster or use less memory. Developing a strategy, establishing solid measuring and visualization techniques as well as knowing about algorithmic basics and datastructures are the foundation for a successful optimization. The tutorial will cover these topics. Examples will give you a hands-on experience on how to approach efficiently.

Python is a great language. But it can be slow compared to other languages
for certain types of tasks. If applied appropriately, optimization may reduce
program runtime or memory consumption considerably. But this often comes at a price. Optimization can be time consuming and the optimized program may be more complicated. This, in turn, means more maintenance effort. How do you find out if it is worthwhile to optimize your program? Where should you start? This tutorial will help you to answer these questions. You will learn how to find  an optimization strategy based on quantitative and objective criteria. You will experience that one's gut feeling what to optimize is often wrong.

The solution to this problem is: „Measure, Measure, and Measure!“. You will
learn how to measure program run times as well as profile CPU and memory.
There are great tools available. You will learn how to use some of them.
Measuring is not easy because, by definition, as soon as you start to measure,
you influence your system. Keeping this impact as small as possible is important. Therefore, we will cover different measuring techniques.

Furthermore, we will look at algorithmic improvements. You will see that the
right data structure for the job can make a big difference. Finally, you will
learn about different caching techniques.

## Software Requirements

You will need Python 3.7 installed on your laptop. Python 2.7 or 3.5/3.6
should also work. Python 3.x is strongly preferred.
You may use Python 3.8 if is released at the time of the tutorial and all
dependencies can be installed.

### JupyterLab

I will use a JupyterLab for the tutorial because it makes a very good
teaching tool. You are welcome to use the setup you prefer, i.e editor, IDE,
REPL. If you also like to use a JupyterLab, I recommend `conda` for
easy installation. Similarly to `virtualenv`, `conda` allows creating isolated
environments but allows binary installs for all platforms.

There are two ways to install `Jupyter` via `conda`:

1. Use [Minconda][1]. This is a  small install and (after you installed it)
   you can use the command  `conda` to create an environment:
  `conda create -n pycon2019 python=3.7`
   Now you can change into this environment:
   `conda activate pycon2019`. The prompt should change to `(pycon2019)`.
   Now you can install JupyterLab: `conda install jupyterlab`.

2. Install [Anaconda][2] and you are ready to go if you don't mind installing
   lots of packages from the scientific field.

Personally, I prefer the Miniconda approach.


### Working witch ``conda`` environments

After creating a new environment, the system might still work with some
stale settings. Even when the command ``which`` tells you that you are using an
executable from your environment, this might actually not be the case.
If you see strange behavior using a command line tool in your environment,
use ``hash -r`` and try again.

[1]: https://conda.io/miniconda.html
[2]: https://www.anaconda.com/download/


### Tools

You can install these with ``conda`` or ``pip`` (in the active ``conda`` environment):

* [SnakeViz][3]
* [line_profiler][4]
* [Pympler][5]
* [memory_profiler][6]




#### Linux

Using the package manager of your OS is alternative if you prefer this approach.

The pandas library is a powerful tool for multiple phases of the data science workflow, including data cleaning, visualization, and exploratory data analysis. However, the size and complexity of the pandas library makes it challenging to discover the best way to accomplish any given task.

In this tutorial, you'll use pandas to answer questions about multiple real-world datasets. Through each exercise, you'll learn important data science skills as well as """"best practices"""" for using pandas. By the end of the tutorial, you'll be more fluent at using pandas to correctly and efficiently answer your own data science questions.

[Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/) lets you write tests that should pass for every case… then finds bugs by generating inputs you wouldn’t have looked for. Even better, you get to save time by writing fewer but more powerful tests, so this process improves your productivity as well as your code!

- Learn what property-based testing is, and how it relates to [other kinds of tests](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/a-bunch-of-tests/)!
- Write your first property-based test, with example code and an overview of common tactics!
- Describe inputs - use and compose strategies, then define your own or infer them from other code!
- Use `hypothesis.stateful` to generate and test whole programs
- Get the low-down on Hypothesis: performance tips, debugging tools, and more!

You’ll be ready to find real bugs by half way through the tutorial; and by the end you’ll be ready to use Hypothesis in ways we never imagined. 

There will be dedicated time for Q&A about applying Hypothesis (or PBT ideas) in your domain, testing anything from web apps to big data pipelines to other languages, before you leave to drag the world kicking and screaming into a new and terrifying age of high quality software.

Many researchers rely strongly on numerical computations.  Unfortunately, testing scientific code is a hard task. Often there is no ground truth available for comparison and the end result of the simulation is unknown even to the code developer herself/himself. Often the user-base of the scientific code is small and the work environment does not provide incentives for testing. 

However, there are always parts of the code that are relatively easy to cover by Unit Tests. Scientific pipelines could and should have Regressions Tests, which ensure that previously developed software still performs after changes in the code, or in external libraries and computational environment. An automatic test suite should not be a burden and can become a game-changer even for a small programming project.

This tutorial is meant to be an introduction to testing in general and to pytest library. Pytest is a full feature tool to test the Python code, it offers a simple way to get started and scales from simple unit testing to complex functional testing. We will begin with simple assert statements and finish with pytest.fixture and pytest.parametrization. The tutorial will also cover a simple integration of the tests suit with Continuous Integration platforms using GitHub and Travis/CircleCI.

**Audience:** The tutorial is designed for scientist and data scientists who would like incorporate testing to their everyday work. We expect that people know basic Python and NumPy, and are familiar with simple shell commands. Basic knowledge of Git/GitHub will be useful in the second half of the tutorial.

Like many other developers, I had struggled with finding the right mix of security and simplicity for securing APIs. Some standards from the IETF have made it possible to accomplish both. Let me show you how to utilize existing libraries to lock
down you API without writing a ton of code.

You are a developer. Maybe you're building a rich web experience, like a single page app using JavaScript and a framework like React, Angular or Vue. Maybe you have multiple clients besides web on mobile platforms like iOS or Android. Maybe you have an external facing public API for use by clients with many diverse needs. One things is for sure: you need a robust API.

That API should be able to evolve over time to meet the growing and changing demands of the business and your clients. The frameworks and paradigms we choose as we develop any software can help or hinder that change. A well-designed GraphQL API enables flexibility and stability across changes, as well as easy service discovery and thinner clients with less responsibilities, ensuring that your application grows successfully over time.

The tutorial will focus on building a GraphQL API using the __Python__ library __Graphene__ with a __Django__ backend as a vehicle for teaching the principals of evolutionary API that can be applied across any tech stack, including REST, as well as the more practical concerns of working with __Graphene__ and designing your API for GraphQL.

A frontend, built using __JavaScript__ with __React__ and the __Apollo__ GraphQL client library, will be made available so users can understand the full-stack considerations of building this API and reacting to evolving concerns over time. Writing JavaScript will not be required, but being comfortable reading it and setting up a local environment will help get more out of this tutorial.

We'll attempt to answer questions such as:

- When is using GraphQL for an API most effective?
- How do I get started with GraphQL in Python?
- What does it mean for an API to be Relay-compliant? What benefits are there? Drawbacks if we don't comply?
- How can we make use of field arguments for sorting, filtering and other concerns?
- What kinds of changes are safe to make to my API as clients begin consuming it?
- How can I ensure my GraphQL API performs well and we avoid the dreaded _N+1 As A Service_ problem?
- How should I design mutation responses for my GraphQL API to serve client needs?
- How can multiple stakeholders decide how to evolve the API together?

You've started to """"containerize"""" your applications by writing a Dockerfile or two, and now you want to run your containers in a cluster. But Kubernetes is quite different from Docker: the smallest unit of deployment is not a container, but a *pod*; pods are accessed through specialized load balancers called *services*; there are *labels* and *selectors* everywhere; and everything is created by expressing desired state with YAML, lots of YAML.

In this hands-on tutorial, we will learn about Kubernetes and its key concepts, both in theory (we will become familiar with all the things evoked in the previous paragraph) and in practice (we will know how to use them to deploy and scale our applications).

Kubernetes has the reputation of being a complex system with a steep learning curve. We will see that it is, indeed, a complex system, but that it is possible to tame its most essential features in just a few hours.

This tutorial is an Introduction to Bayesian data science through the lens of simulation or hacker statistics. We will become familiar with many common probability distributions through i) matching them to real-world stories & ii) simulating them. We will work with joint/conditional probabilities, Bayes Theorem, prior/posterior distributions and likelihoods, while seeing their applications in real-world data analyses. We’ll see the utility of Bayesian inference in parameter estimation and comparing groups and we’ll wrap up with a dive into the wonderful world of probabilistic programming.

Design patterns are prepackaged solutions to common software design problems. We get two important benefits when using them. Firstly, we get a way to solve typical software development issues by using a proven solution. Secondly, we get a shared vocabulary that allows us to communicate more effectively with other software designers. Getting acquainted with design patterns is the next step to become a better object oriented programmer.

In this tutorial we'll answer some of the most important questions surrounding design patterns: What are they? How can we use them in our programs? When should we avoid them? We'll also have the opportunity to explore and play with the Python implementations of some of the classical design patterns made famous by the Gang of Four (Gamma, Helm, Johnson & Vlissides) while learning relevant design principles at the same time. Don't forget to bring your own laptop with your preferred Python 3 development environment.

In data science (in its all its variants) a significant part of an individual’s time is spent preparing data into a digestible format. In general, a data science pipeline starts with the acquisition of raw data which is then manipulated through ETL processes and leads to a series of analytics. 
Good data pipelines can be used to automate and schedule these steps, help with monitoring tasks, and even to dynamically train models. On top of that, they make the analyses easier to reproduce and productise.

In this workshop, you will learn how to migrate from ‘scripts soups’ (a set of scripts that should be run in a particular order) to robust, reproducible and easy-to-schedule data pipelines in Airflow. First, we will learn how to write simple recurrent ETL pipelines. We will then integrate logging and monitoring capabilities. And we will end using Airflow along with Jupyter Notebooks and paper mill to produce reproducible analytics reports.
