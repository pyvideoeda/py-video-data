Where static outputs and tabular data may render patterns opaque, human visual analysis can uncover volumes and lead to more robust programming and better data products.

The final result was a well-tested piece of Python code, which could be compiled to be very performant as well. \n\nThe goal of this talk is to introduce you to the basics of interpreters and the tools available in RPython to build one.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",

        "description": "Speakers: Michael Tom-Wing, Christie Wilson\n\nIn this tutorial we’ll be taking you on a journey into the wonderful land of unit testing with pytest. We’ll be taking a step by step approach by iteratively adding unit test coverage to our awesome Cat In A Box™ project. You will also get a crash course on Git, Github, virtualenvs, and test automation. By the end, we hope that you’ll have a desire to bring testing to our own projects!\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",

However, there’s still a lot of knowledge necessary to use TLS in Python properly, and a lot of useful information for setting up and debugging TLS stacks that’s hard to come by.

In this session, we’ll get practical, hands-on experience with core concepts in machine learning with TensorFlow, an open source deep learning library. We’ll introduce the basics of TensorFlow, including how to ingest and prepare raw data for use, run a variety of algorithms to gain insight from the data, and have some fun with visualization.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
