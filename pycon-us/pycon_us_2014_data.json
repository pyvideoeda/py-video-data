Bayesian statistics are usually presented mathematically, but many of the ideas are easier to understand computationally. People who know Python can get started quickly and use Bayesian analysis to solve real problems. This tutorial is based on material and case studies from Think Bayes (O'Reilly Media).\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2014 and https://github.com/PyCon/2014-slides",

With more people than ever interested in teaching Python to kids, we're here to address how to organize a class.

        "description": "Speaker: Greg Ward\n\nUnit testing is like public transit: everyone agrees it's a good thing for other people to do. It's easier to swallow when you see how unit testing improves not only the correctness of your code, but the design as well. I'll walk through a real-life case study where adding unit tests turned a pretty good module into an even better one: easier to understand, extend, and reuse.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2014 and https://github.com/PyCon/2014-slides",

Software guarantees are commonly incomplete with good reason: promises that are narrow and few are most easily kept across wide ranges of platforms and long times. We define the space of a module's allowed behavior to be its \"behavioral envelope\" and show that thinking and speaking in terms of envelopes eases maintenance and makes APIs delightful.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2014 and https://github.com/PyCon/2014-slides",

While it is possible to write Python programs without active of knowledge of them, knowing how they work provides a deeper understanding about the language. Using examples, you will learn how they work and when to use as well as when better not to use them. Use cases provide working code that can serve as a base for own solutions.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2014 and https://github.com/PyCon/2014-slides",
