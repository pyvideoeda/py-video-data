A very fast introduction to Python for software developers with experience in other languages.  Instead of a traditional top-down presentation of Python's features, syntax, and semantics, students are immersed in the language bottom-up with hundreds of small examples using the interactive interpreter to quickly gain familiarity with most of the core language features.

We’ve entered the era of the $1000 human genome, and soon it will be straightforward to get your own genome sequenced by a commercial company.  But what does the data mean? What information can you get out of your genomic sequence? And what are the barriers to deeper analysis?  What kinds of algorithms and databases are used in genomic analysis? All this, and more, will be revealed in this talk.
