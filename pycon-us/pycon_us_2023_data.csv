Ever spent a day writing tests, only to discover that you missed a bug because of some edge case you didn’t know about? Does it ever feel like writing tests is just a formality - that you already know your test cases will pass?

Property-based testing might be just what you need!

After this introduction to property-based testing, you’ll be comfortable with Hypothesis, a friendly but powerful property-based testing library. You’ll also known how to check and enforce robust properties in your code, and will have hands-on experience finding real bugs.

Where traditional example-based tests require you to write out each exact scenario to check - for example, assert divide(3, 4) == 0.75 - property-based tests are generalised and assisted. You describe what kinds of inputs are allowed, write a test that should pass for any of them, and Hypothesis does the rest!

from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

@given(a=st.integers(), b=st.integers())
def test_divide(a, b):
   result = a / b
   assert a == b * result
There’s the obvious ZeroDivisionError, fixable with b = st.integers().filter(lambda b: b != 0), but there’s another bug lurking. Can you see it? Hypothesis can!

We assume that you are comfortable with traditional unit tests - reading, running, and writing; as well as familar with ideas like assertions.

Literate programming allows developers to tell a story with their codes, improving the understanding of the project, focusing on documentation, and making it easier to onboard developers. Although being a very well-regarded concept discussed by respected researchers like Donald Knuth, literate programming tools like Jupyter notebooks are considered inefficient for serious software development. This perception has limited Jupyter notebooks to simple python scripts and educational materials.

The Nbdev library has proven that literate programming is useful in developing big and serious projects, like FastAi. This tutorial will show attendees how to get the benefits of literate programming while also following software development best practices. We'll get hands-on experience in writing and publishing a Python Package while using Jupyter Notebooks. In addition to publishing the package, we'll also learn how to deploy the docs, run simple tests and run these tests on CI/CD, making sure that our package will only get published if the tests pass.

Even though this tutorial uses Jupyter Notebooks and Nbdev the student doesn't need previous knowledge of these tools. A simple computer with Python and pip installed is all we'll use.

OpenTelemetry sits at the application layer, and exports Traces, Metrics, and Logs to a backend for observing. It is extremely helpful and beneficial to developers in mean ""time-to-detection"" and ""time-to-resolution"" of bugs and issues that occur at the application layer; this ranges from detecting and alerting for errors raised (such as TypeError), to finding that a specific microservice (such as AWS Lambda) ran for twice as long as usual, all the way to seeing the output of a service and comparing it to the expected output to find a bug in the logic of the service.

This tutorial is geared towards beginner/intermediate Python developers, who have some experience in Python, its syntax, and very minimal experience in Requests and Flask is needed (extremely popular libraries, with 50k and 60k stars on GitHub, respectively).

Typing is at the center of „modern Python“, and tools (mypy, beartype) and libraries (FastAPI, SQLModel, Pydantic, DocArray) based on it are slowly eating the Python world.

This talks explores the benefits of Python type hints, and shows how they are infiltrating the next big domain: Machine Learning

Target audience: Mainly machine learning practitioners that care about improving their code quality and making use of the ever evolving Python ecosystem. This includes people that focus on model training as well as people that focus on model deployment and serving. The secondary target audience is anyone that likes to know more about Python type hints and how they can be helpful in their code base.

Intended takeaways: The audience should leave the talk with three main learnings: - Why Python type hints are useful - Why they are particularly useful in the ML domain - How they can leverage libraries like DocArray in practice

Preliminary outline: The talk can be seen as two parts:

Part 1: Typing in Python - min 0-5: Introduction - min 5-15: Typing and type hints in Python: Short history, and why is it useful? - min 25-25: Tool landscape: Type checkers (mypy, beartype) and other libraries (Pydantic, FastAPI)

To mitigate this, parts of PyTorch have been moved into C++. This approach goes against the original intent of PyTorch as a Python-based framework and complicates contributions from the community. The PyTorch development team recognized the need to address these challenges while maintaining PyTorch's Python roots and set ambitious goals to improve performance, decrease memory usage, enable state-of-the-art distributed capabilities, and ensure more PyTorch code is written in Python. To achieve these goals, they developed a Python compiler. Attendees of this talk will get an inside look at how the PyTorch development team approached these challenges and implemented their innovative solution to achieve a 43% speedup in performance. We will discuss the benefits and challenges of this approach, as well as the techniques and technologies used to build the PyTorch Python compiler. This talk will provide valuable insights into the development process of and offer attendees a deeper understanding of how PyTorch continues to evolve and innovate.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sKFwS0TEHHM/maxresdefault.jpg,0.0,False,False,public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKFwS0TEHHM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKFwS0TEHHM,

Transportation networks are highly dynamic, goods are always moving from point A to point B and money is being gained or lost every minute. Improving efficiency in a transportation network is critical to the survival of a business that provides transportation and distribution services as well as ensuring timely delivery of goods to customers.

* Finding the optimal match between a driver and a load at the lowest possible cost using Google's ortools;
* Generating recommendations for macro level optimizations to a transportation network using networkX; and 
* Helping the decision making process by answering the question ""Should I accept this work?"" using skfuzzy.

The C implementation, proposed in PEP 305, defines a core tokenizer that has been a reference for many subsequent projects. Two commonly needed features, however, were not addressed in csv.reader(): determining type per column, and converting strings to those types (or columns to arrays). Pandas read_csv() implements automatic type conversion and realization of columns as NumPy arrays (delivered in a DataFrame), with performance good enough to be widely regarded as a benchmark. Pandas implementation, however, does not support all NumPy dtypes. While NumPy offers loadtxt() and genfromtxt() for similar purposes, the former (recently re-implemented in C) does not implement automatic type discovery, while the latter (implemented in Python) suffers poor performance at scale.

To support reading delimited files in StaticFrame (a DataFrame library built on an immutable data model), I needed something different: the full configuration options of Python's csv.reader(); optional type discovery for one or more columns; support for all NumPy dtypes; and performance competitive with Pandas read_csv().

Following the twenty-year tradition of extending csv.reader(), I implemented delimited_to_arrays() as a C extension to meet these needs. Using a family of C functions and structs, Unicode code points are collected per column (with optional type discovery), converted to C-types, and written into NumPy arrays, all with minimal PyObject creation or reference counting. Incorporated in StaticFrame, performance tests across a range of DataFrame shapes and type heterogeneity show significant performance advantages over Pandas. Independent of usage in StaticFrame, delimited_to_arrays() provides a powerful new resource for converting CSV files to NumPy arrays.

Uno de los delitos más comúnmente denunciados es el delito de Grooming (en mi pais tiene una pena de 6 meses a 4 años de prision), el cual consiste en una práctica de ciberacoso por medio de telecomunicaciones electrónicas en la que un adulto engaña a un menor de edad con una finalidad sexual, a travez de redes sociales o la aplicación Whatsapp.

Cuando una persona denuncia este delito y se ordena una pericia informatica por parte de la Justicia, realizo una extracción forense del dispositivo celular en cuestión, obteniendo así las conversaciones realizadas entre el presunto autor del delito y el/la menor de edad. Las conversaciones pueden contener pocas o cientos de oraciones y no siempre tienen contenido explicito relacionado al delito, lo que es complicado en tiempo y esfuerzo para los operadores de la Justicia analizar el significado de cada una de ellas y contextualizarlo. Allí entra en escena el modelo que desarrollé con Python que por medio del procesamiento del lenguaje natural (NLP) y técnicas de machine learning y Deep learning le dan una solución rapida a la confirmación del delito. En el futuro este modelo podrá ser extensible a otros crímenes tal como por ejemplo el femicidio, ya sea previamente al hecho: una mujer pueda utilizarlo desde una aplicación web accesible desde cualquier punto geográfico y pueda predecir en habla hispana una conducta en una conversación realizada con su posible agresor referente al machismo o misoginia, entre otras, o una vez sucedido para confirmar el hecho objeto del crimen por parte de los administradores de la Justicia.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/g77IjJUaNew/maxresdefault.webp,0.0,False,False,public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g77IjJUaNew,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g77IjJUaNew,

Despite a series of the asyncio stdlib improvements for the last few years, it is still challenging to see what’s happening in complex real-world asyncio applications. Particularly, when multiple asyncio libraries and your codes are composed together, it is hard to track down silently swallowed cancellations and resource-hogging floods of tasks triggered by internals of 3rd-party callbacks. Moreoever, such misbehaviors are often observed only in production environments where the app faces the actual workloads and I/O patterns, making it even harder to reproduce.

In this talk, I present an improved version of aiomonitor, called aiomonitor-ng (next generation). The original aiomonitor provides a live access to a running asyncio process using a telnet socket and a basic REPL to inspect the list of tasks and their current stacks. After getting several times of assistance in production debugging with it, I have added more features to help tracking the above issues of asyncio apps running in production: task creation tracker and termination tracker. These trackers keeps the stack traces whenever a new task is created or terminated, and provides a holistic view of chained stack traces when the tasks are nested with arbitrary depths.

aiomonitor-ng also demonstrates a rich async TUI (terminal UI) based on prompt toolkit and Click, with auto-completion of commands and arguments, far enhancing the original version’s simple REPL.

With the improved aiomonitor-ng, I could successfully debug several production bugs.

Where processes run independently and threads switch at the whim of the kernel scheduler, async tasks take a different tradeoff: managing shared state is as easy as in single-threaded synchronous Python, but it’s on you to ensure that there are enough await, async for, and async with statements where tasks can switch to make steady progress.

In this talk, we’ll explore the advantages of structured concurrency - especially error handling, timeouts, cancellation, and readable code - and both convenient and reliable ways to mitigate the problems of cooperative concurrency (when one uncooperative slow task can bring your whole program to a halt). I’ll introduce you to static analysis with flake8-trio and explain how to write your own AST-based tools, and show how dynamic analysis can help us catch anything that slips past that quick and convenient check.

And distributed databases like MongoDB offer a range of consistency levels, from ""eventually consistent"" to ""linearizable"" and many options in between. Plus, non-experts usually confuse ""isolation"" with ""consistency!"" If we don't understand these concepts we risk losing data, or money, or worse. So what's the bottom line?

Isolation: in a simple world, your database runs on one machine and executes each request one-at-a-time. In reality, databases execute requests in parallel, leading to weird phenomena called ""anomalies"". To see why anomalies happen, we'll look at Python code that simulates how a database executes operations. The various isolation levels make different tradeoffs between the anomalies they allow, versus the parallelism they can achieve.

Consistency: distributed databases keep copies of your data on several machines, but these copies go out of sync. This leads to new anomalies: weird phenomena that reveal the out-of-sync data, and make your application feel like it's in a time warp. The various consistency levels make tradeoffs between anomalies versus latency. It depends how long you're willing to wait for your data changes to be synced across all the machines. Again, we'll look at a Python simulation to understand these anomalies.

You don't need to know all the names and details of every consistency and isolation level. You can refer to this handy chart. And you don't need to read all the academic papers, but I'll name four or five that are worth your time.

We will begin by discussing the basics of the ASGI specification and how it works. Then, we will move on to writing a simple ASGI app using pure, hand-crafted Python, without any frameworks or libraries. After that, we will cover ASGI middleware, which is a powerful tool that allows us to modify the behavior of our ASGI apps without changing the underlying code.

In this talk, we will show that it is possible to catch Tensor shape mismatches without running your code by (a) representing the symbolic shape of a tensor (e.g., H x W x B) with explicit type annotations, called shape types, and (b) using a type checker to catch mismatches. We will also show how shape types can help us understand code faster by allowing us to see the shape of a tensor variable right in the IDE.

While Python makes it very easy to get something up and running, the highly dynamic nature of the language abstracts memory management away from us and makes it very difficult to understand what is going on when we run out of memory or when we have memory leaks. This is where memory profilers come into play.

Memory profilers are tools that allow us to understand how our applications are using memory. Not only can they help us diagnose why our programs are using so much memory, but also they can also help us optimize our code to be faster by using smarter allocation patterns.

Being able to understand how to use memory profilers effectively is an essential skill for any Python developer, especially those working on programs that involve the transformation of large amounts of data, large-scale applications, or long-running processes.

This talk will cover the basics of memory profilers, how they work, and how to use them effectively.

In this talk, I tell the story behind CPython's latest updates of the list sort function.

Aims: entertain people with twists of history and algorithmic puzzles, which tell a lovely story of how a seemingly useless piece of theory lead to the fastest and most elegant solution of a practical challenge.

Target audience: geeks believing in the power of solid algorithmic thinking; programmers interested in engineering performance-critical code; all Python enthusiast curious about what makes (sorting lists in) Python fast.

Content: After using Quicksort for a long while, Tim Peters invented Timsort, a clever Mergesort variant, for the CPython reference implementation of Python. Timsort is both effective in Python and a popular export product: it is used in many languages and frameworks, notably OpenJDK, the Android runtime, and the V8 JavaScript engine.

Despite this success, algorithms researchers eventually pinpointed two flaws in Timsort's underlying algorithm: The first could lead to a stack overflow in CPython (and Java); although it has meanwhile been fixed, it is curious that 10 years of widespread use didn't bring it to surface. The second flaw is related to performance: the order in which detected sorted segments, the “runs” in the input, are merged, can be 50% more costly than necessary. Based on ideas from the little known puzzle of optimal alphabetic trees, the Powersort merge policy finds nearly optimal merging orders with negligible overhead, and is now (Python 3.11.0) part of the CPython implementation.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/QtG858LRQI0/maxresdefault.webp,0.0,False,False,public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG858LRQI0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG858LRQI0,

Manually managing consistent linter versions and configurations across codebases requires endless effort. Linter analysis on large codebases is slow. Linters may slow down developers by asking them to fix trivial issues. Running linters in distributed CI jobs makes it hard to understand the overall developer experience.

To handle these scale challenges, we developed a reusable linter framework that releases new linter updates automatically, reuses consistent configurations, runs linters on only updated code to speedup runtime, collects logs and metrics to provide observability, and builds auto fixes for common linter issues. Our linter runs are fast and scalable. Every week, they run 10k times on multiple millions of lines of code in over 25 codebases, generating 25k suggestions for more than 200 developers. Its autofixes also save 20 hours of developer time every week.

To minimize disruptions for users, projects are incentivized to plan these transitions carefully, which may include API deprecations, where messages warning users of upcoming changes are added to the affected APIs while they’re still functional. However, this imposes extra workload for the project’s maintainers, as both old and new versions of the API must be kept functional throughout the transition period.

As a maintainer of a software project undergoing preparations for a major version release, I recently found myself in a similar situation: our goal was to provide backward compatibility with the previous version for as long as possible, without impacting the development of new features. Practically, this included dealing with a radical restructuring of the Python codebase, resulting in hundreds of modules being relocated, split, or removed. Was there any way to ensure that the deprecated import paths could still be used without errors, without having to maintain two separate versions of the package?

Fortunately, the answer to “can you do that in Python?” is more often than not “yes!”; for this particular case, the path to success turned out to be through the importlib package of the standard library. For something so close to Python’s internals, importlib is both accessible and extensible, allowing ordinary code to customize almost completely how and what modules can be imported---including modules that are not there anymore!

This intermediate-level talk will present a complete solution based on Python’s importlib machinery that allows to redirect modules or module attributes with deprecations in a simple, robust, and scalable way.

With basic python experience you can use libraries like pandas and tools like Jupyter Notebooks to analyze and manipulate data sets. By apply Test-Driven Development practices to you analysis you can feel confident about what your building.

You can build well developed and well tested cleaning scripts and functions using pytest and use these functions in your notebooks and scripts.

You can even build simple recommendation engines using libraries such as Scikit Learn! 

As a part of this talk we will walk through the process of data analysis, data cleaning, feature preparation, and building a simple movie recommendation engine.  As we move through those steps, my main focus is to teach engineers how they can incorporate Test-Driven Development into the data cleaning process and the building of our engine.  I will also walk through strategies for data analysis and explain at a high level a couple ML concepts that we can use.

As participants get the chance to see live examples of how to use Test Driven Development in data analysis and machine learning they can get a handle on some core concepts and learn how to ensure quality in the code that they produce.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/V7Dnb8E9NYo/maxresdefault.webp,0.0,False,False,public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7Dnb8E9NYo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7Dnb8E9NYo,

The implementation of full-text search can be complex and many adopt the strategy of using dedicated search engines in addition to the database, but in most cases this strategy turns out to be a big problem of architecture and performance.

In this talk we'll see a pythonic way to implement full-text search on a website using only Django and PostgreSQL, taking advantage of all the innovations introduced in latest years, and we'll analyze the problems of using additional search engines with examples deriving from my experience on djangoproject.com.

Through this talk you can learn how to add a full-text search on your website, if it's based on Django and PostgreSQL, or you can learn how to update the search function of your website if you use other search engines.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/NS31C726xEw/maxresdefault.webp,0.0,False,False,public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NS31C726xEw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NS31C726xEw,

We deal with this scale by using Celery and Kubernetes as our tasks infrastructure, letting us allocate dedicated workers and queues to each type of task based on its requirements. Originally, this was configured manually.

As our customer base grew, we noticed that heavier and longer tasks were grabbing all the resources and causing unacceptable queues in our pipeline. Moreover, some of the heavier tasks required significantly more memory, leading to OOM kills and infrastructure issues.

If we could classify tasks by their expected duration and memory requirements, we could have segregated tasks in Celery based on these properties and thus minimized interruptions to the rest of the pipeline. However, the variance in the size and granularity of the fetched data made it impossible to classify if a task was about to take one minute or one hour.

Our challenge was: how do we categorize these tasks, accurately and automatically? To solve the issue we implemented a machine-learning model that could predict the expected duration and memory usage of a given task. Using Celery’s advanced task routing capabilities, we could then dynamically configure different task queues based on the model's prediction.

This raised another challenge - how could we use the classified queues in the best way? Configuring workers statically for each queue would be inadequate at scale. We utilized Kubernetes’ vertical and horizontal autoscaling capabilities to dynamically allocate workers for each classified queue based on its length. This improved our ability to respond to pipeline load automatically, increasing performance and availability. Additionally, we were able to deploy shorter-lived workers on AWS Spot instances, giving us higher performance while lowering cloud costs.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/s6AVuWc6E1w/maxresdefault.webp,0.0,False,False,public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6AVuWc6E1w,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6AVuWc6E1w,

Or more precisely, building that binary wheel correctly. Lucky for us, a few amazing community-led projects hide all that complexity from us, so we can instead focus on shipping and using Python code.

One of Python's strong suits is its ability to use native C and C++ code, which is a big reason why it’s the number one language for date science and machine learning applications. However, distributing native code in Python libraries is far from trivial: subtle issues in the build process can result in runtime issues that are extremely difficult to track down.

This talk will showcase some notable examples of how things can go wrong, while also helping users and maintainers recognise these typical error scenarios. We will learn how to avoid these issues and what users can do when they encounter such issues when using a library.

The audience will learn about the manylinux standard and its role in standardizing Linux platform wheels. We will also take a look at the cibuildwheel project, which offers library authors a simple solution to automate the building and distribution of manylinux wheels.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GPgcUvnG7CQ/maxresdefault.jpg,0.0,False,False,public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPgcUvnG7CQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPgcUvnG7CQ,

Over the last year I've been working full time to rebuild Pydantic from the ground up, using Rust for virtually all the validation and serialization logic. Pydantic V2, with these changes included, has recently been released.

In this talk I will give a brief introduction to Pydantic and the new features in Pydantic V2 before diving into how the use of Rust has allowed us to completely change the architecture of Pydantic to make it easier to extend and maintain while also improving performance significantly.

The majority of the talk will be devoted to using examples from the pydantic V2 code base to demonstrate the advantages (and disadvantages) of writing libraries like Pydantic in Rust. I'll cover the real life trade-offs and design decisions you might face while implementing logic in Rust rather than Python.

This talk should be interesting to any Python developer who's interested in combining Python and Rust - no knowledge of Rust or Pydantic is required. However if you'd like to get some context or learn more about the topics discussed, here are some useful resources:
