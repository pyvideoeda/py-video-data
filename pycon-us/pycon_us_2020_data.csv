¿Cuántas veces has encontrado en PyPI una increíble biblioteca que aparentemente resuelve tu problema específico pero, cuando la introduces en tu proyecto, encuentras documentación totalmente obsoleta o incompleta? ¿O es el responsable de mantener una biblioteca bien construida con código bien organizado y probado, pero nadie la usa?

Claro, todos hemos pasado por esto, pero cometimos el mismo error con nuestros propios proyectos y dejamos la documentación para más tarde, o estamos contentos con un pequeño archivo README que contiene ejemplos simples, o peor, simplemente la ignoramos pensando que solo un código bien escrito es suficiente para que otros usen nuestro proyecto.

En esta charla quiero presentar 5 retos particulares de hacer ciencia de datos en países latinoamericanos y cómo enfrentarse a ellos con éxito a través de 5 historias de la vida real. Las historias vienen de mi experiencia trabajando en Quantil, una empresa con 11 años haciendo consultoría en ciencia de datos en Colombia. Latinoamérica es una región con una historia diversa y compleja que nos dejó atrás en varios aspectos, incluso el tecnológico y científico. Aunque está cambiando, un científico de datos o una empresa que se dedique a esto enfrenta retos como la falta de confianza en software open source (y por tanto en Python), el déficit de profesionales capacitados holísticamente en Python y otras tecnologías de facto, el desorden de los datos a usar en las organizaciones, entre otros. Finalmente presentaré mi visión del futuro de la ciencia de datos en la región y su impacto en los países que decidan aprovecharla.

I am building a small permaculture farm in Southern California. I have written computer vision programs in Python to read the water meter, optimize water use, track coyotes, rabbits, raccoons and bobcats, etc. The farm is set up like an ongoing science project. I am running Python on 20 Raspberry Pi computers with PiCameras and sensors. The RPi’s capture images, detect motion and select a subset of images. Did the water meter move? Was a coyote seen? If so, images are sent to a hub computer via PyZMQ. The hub computer uses Python and OpenCV to do more advanced processing like reading the water meter digits or keeping critter counts by season. This arrangement demonstrates ways that Python can be helpful in developing IOT networks with multiple cameras and sensors.

In this talk I will describe the hub and spoke design that distributes processing across a mix of RPi’s and larger computers. I’ll cover the pros and cons of PyZMQ messaging for image transfer. I’ll describe OpenCV techniques in Python that have been helpful on both the RPi’s and the hub computer. All the programs are pure Python, and they leverage fast libraries written in C, like OpenCV and ZMQ by using Python bindings. This is an open source project with all the Python source code available on GitHub. Hardware “how to’s” & photos are also on GitHub. Pictures of my farm and my favorite coyotes are also on GitHub…because why not?

I am sometimes a bit too good at this and I often move my car on days I don’t need to. Since alternate side of the street parking is often canceled on days where there are holidays, or bad weather, there is a Twitter handle @NYCASP, which posts daily and whenever there is an emergency situation.

This talk is about doctests — a way to embed examples and unit tests in docstrings. I describe what they are, how to write them, and interesting ways in which they can be used. Doctests make it easy to interactively develop code by defining “demo” inputs which can be copied into IPython. The side effect is a unit test. This is test-driven-development at its best. I explain the technical details of doctest syntax, directives, parsing, and execution.

Unfortunately, Python’s builtin doctest module has a restrictive syntax, which makes it difficult to use. In the second part of the talk I introduce an alternative: Xdoctest, a new, but stable package for parsing and running doctests (with optional pytest integration). I explain why doctest’s regex-based parser is fundamentally limited and how xdoctest’s ast-based parser is the remedy. I demonstrate how to use xdoctest and discuss its advantages and disadvantages. By the end of this talk you feel confident in writing, running, and developing with doctests.

why list comprehensions exist and why people use them (yes you can always use a loop instead)
how to use list, set, an dictionary comprehensions as well as generator expressions
when and how to easily turn a for loop into a comprehension
why list comprehensions are often hard to read and how to make your comprehensions readable
When to use generator expressions instead of list comprehensions
when and how not to use comprehensions (they’re not a replacement for all loops)
Comprehensions are a unique tool for a unique task. Even if you dislike them, understanding how they work will help you better understand the Python code you find in the wild.

Python is well-known as a programming language without static types. This means that you don’t need to say what a given variable will hold, or whether your function will return a string or an integer (or sometimes one, and sometimes another!). This has historically made Python a very flexible and beginner-friendly language.

In this talk, we’ll discuss the advantages and disadvantages to a static type system, as well as recent efforts to introduce static typing to Python via optional “type hints” and various tools to aid in adding types to Python code.

Black box debugging is an idea where we add low footprint and encoded debug logs in the production code which drastically increases the chances of detecting the cause of a bug without requiring a recurrence with additional logs (read Debug Logs).

Traditionally, we tend to include a limited amount of logs in the production code because writing the logs on the disk is a costly affair and can potentially impact the performances, but at the same time if something goes wrong, then we need the logs to debug the system.

So what if I tell you that you can have debug logs in the production code without impacting the performance of the code…!!! I bet you’ll be pleasantly surprised.

After a certain point engineers typically decide to either go down an individual contributor path or a management one. Recently, I decided to try engineering management. My company had me manage six engineers in a recently formed team. In my first six months as a manager I developed the team’s process for getting work done, learned the basics of managing career development, and positioned my team within the larger engineering organization. I also learned about balancing competing priorities and moving a diverse set of personalities and desires towards a common goal.
In this talk I intend to talk specifically about the role of a manager of a single team. I will go over the types of problems a manager is responsible for and discuss the value a good manager can bring to a team/organization. I will help attendees understand the perspective of their current manager and help them decide if management is something they would be interested in trying out themselves.

It is common for developers to overlook the documentation of their works. They are either on a time crunch, lack the proper tooling, or simply just forget to create and update the documentation. Whatever the cause behind this, it is not a proper excuse for not keeping the documentation up to date. However, for all our development processes there are few as neglected as the documentation process. Documentation should be treated as important as the code that makes up the project. So, let’s move the documentation into the code. With modern documentation tools such as MkDocs and Sphinx, both of which are Python powered tools, and Continuous Integration tools we can now include docs in the commit. They can be reviewed in code reviews, built and versioned in a CI tool, and even tested for things such as correct code examples and broken links. This is the process that the developer knows, understands, and enjoys. I introduced a team to this exact workflow and a working pipeline; all they had to do was keep the documentation up to date. This team currently has some of the most up to date documentation in a company of near two thousand engineers, and they never complain about writing/updating documentation. It’s just part of the workflow.

Attendees will walk away with a new mindset on how to handle documentation, a list of tools that can aid in this process, and a proven, easy-to-implement method that works well for real engineers in a production setting.

9 years ago an initial group of 7 women met at PyCon USA 2011 began the world of what we know today as PyLadies. Since 2011, PyLadies has grown to 100+ chapters worldwide and the growth doesn’t seem to be stopping anytime soon! What has made PyLadies so successful in the past - it’s decentralization and high degree of chapter autonomy - has presented PyLadies with unseen new challenges in 2020 such as burnout, resource stagnation, and ultimately not allowed PyLadies to respond to the global community of 2020.

Join regional PyLadies organizers as they present what PyLadies has in store for the future including a global vision for community engagement and open source projects open to all.

a strategy to generate a rhyme / without a human spending any time

Computers may not yet be able to write poetry with soul, but we can teach them to write poetry with style! By combining Markov chain random text generation with a pronunciation dictionary in Python’s Natural Language ToolKit (NLTK), we can generate a poem that has both rhyme and meter.

Random text generation is a fun, beginner-friendly project with a lot of potential depth for the curious and creative. This talk will cover how to generate random writing based on a source text, as well as how to use NLTK to enhance the output, and conclude with a brand new Shakespearean sonnet!

Many people like Python for its simplicity and beauty. But every statement in Python, even the simple one, produces a lot of events during the program execution. These events are usually hidden from a user, so it helps developers to skip low-level implementation details and focus on bigger things.

At the same time many parts of this hidden information are very useful and interesting to examine. The good news is that the Python Runtime allows to retrieve it really simply, so there is no need to configure additional libraries or pass additional parameters to interpreter. Everybody can do it right inside their Python code.

During this talk we will learn how Python allows to inspect current program state during the execution. We will learn about Python memory model, variables, frame objects and about useful information they store. After that we will discuss several powerful tools which are based on the runtime information and which can be very helpful for any Python programmer in their everyday life.

How do you test that your network is healthy? You probably ping a few things, run some show commands, and watch for open trouble tickets. I don’t think I’ll stir up a ton of controversy by saying that’s a really bad method. With the move towards network automation, NetDevOps, and Network Reliability Engineering (NRE), we need to have robust, repeatable tests to check the state of the network from Layer 1 to 7.

pyATS is an open source network test framework that was built by software developers for network developers. It provides all the tools automation engineers need to describe test cases, run jobs, gather reports, and make the entire process part of your network automation pipeline. In this talk, we’ll look at everything you need to write your first few test cases, and discuss strategies for what you should test, and when.

Extending Python with C is a technique that many popular modules use for OS-level operations, serialization, performance, and more, but dealing with C code is not simple: you need to take care of memory, understand pointers, and write many lines of code for simple tasks. Luckily for you, there is C++.

Wait! Don’t be scared!

I know maybe you heard bad stories and saw complicated pieces of C code, but: are you aware of how C has been evolving?
The latest C++ standards include many goodies that smell a bit of Python, and I will show them to you.

During this talk, you will learn how to include C features into CPython modules, how to create hybrid applications**, and even to extend existent C applications with Python, making them scriptable**.

This talk is intended for developers who are familiar with Python and know basic C, but you don’t need to know any C++ to take the most out of it.

How to find duplicate records in a dataset without unique identifiers, like the SSN for US citizens? The answer is to use Record Deduplication techniques: look for matches by cleaning and comparing attributes in a fuzzy way. In this talk, you’ll learn with Python examples how to do this without needing any expert Data Science knowledge.

There are several critical applications of Record Deduplication in government and business. For example, by deduping records from Census data, the Australian government was able to find there were 250,000 fewer people in the country than they previously thought. This reduction impacted the estimations of government agencies and even caused the revision of economic projections. Similarly, businesses can use record deduplication techniques to clean up customers’ data. In this talk, you’ll learn with Python examples the main concepts of Record Deduplication: what kinds of problems can be solved, what’s the most common workflow for the process, what algorithms are involved, and which tools and libraries you can use. Although some of the discussed concepts are related to data mining, any intermediate-level Python developer will be able to learn the basics of how to dedupe data using Python.

Customers’ data is important. The number of privacy laws in recent years has grown from 20 to 100, to name a few: PCI compliance in the payment industry, the European GDPR regulation, and the Brazilian LGPD. All these new regulations attempt to bridge an old gap: data anonymity. How to handle data and protect the individuals comprised in it? Companies often face lawsuits to compensate for personal information breaches in their database.

Many times production data is copied onto test, QA or staging environments, only to be followed by exposure to the eyes of testers, receivers, or unauthorized developers on machines less protected than production environments. It is not seldom for files also to be shared with external partners, who often require but a small part of the data transferred, and granting access to user’s data might be a breach. If in one hand sharing data is both necessary and inevitable, on the other technologies that assure the privacy of individuals details are no longer only desirable, but essential.

In this talk, we will approach two important topics: how to manage data whilst securing users’ personal information and how to do it in machine learning models. Exposing different techniques of anonymization and pseudonymization (k-anonymity, differential privacy, and others), showing that solving the anonymity problem is much more complex than replacing names, last names, and social security numbers.

When you invoke a function, how does it know how many arguments to expect? How does it distinguish between local and global (and enclosing) variables? How does it know that you defined the function with args and/or *kwargs? And where does it store such things as docstrings, annotations, and defaults?

The short answer is that Python functions are objects – no different from integers, strings, and dicts. And like all other bjects,
functions have attributes. It turns out that those attributes are the source of functions’ power.

In this talk, we’ll peek into function attributes, gaining an understanding of (and appreciation for) the way in which functions are built. We’ll also see the relationship between attributes, functions, and Python bytecodes. And while we’ll be dissecting many functions, I can assure you that none of them will be harmed in our quest for deeper understanding.

Most people around the world are getting more and more interested in living a long and healthy life nowadays. And many studies have proven that growing house plants, as long as being a trend, improves health.
The truth is, we are so busy with work, and even when we get home, that we do not have enough time to properly water our plants when they need it.

In this talk, you are going to learn how to build a functional and beginner friendly system to keep your plants alive using different sensors, microcontrollers and CircuitPython.

This system is going to water your plants based on their necessities and, step by step, you are going to add components and functionalities to the system; for instance, you will give your plants “a voice” to inform you about their deficiencies.
Moreover, in this project, you will learn how to create a Web application with Flask, how to set up a Raspberry Pi as a local server and how to use a cloud IoT service for Data Analysis.

Finally, you will see how Circuitpython can play an amazing role in these kind of situations, by helping plants to survive longer, and by making our responsibility lighter.

N+1 queries are as common as blog posts about how to solve them. What happens when you want to get a list of blog posts, the comments on them, and the comments’ respective authors? An exponential number of queries. The rise of GraphQL and REST APIs that provide “include” semantics make these situations increasingly common and painful. Clever use of prefetch_related and select_related may help in a pinch but never fully solve the problem. Learn how to identify these inefficient queries and optimize them using SQL aggregations and LATERAL JOINs.

Machine learning is hungry for data, usually collected from users of a product and often including a lot of personal or sensitive information. What if we could build accurate machine learning models while still preserving user privacy? There’s a growing number of tools in Python to help us achieve this, ranging from federated learning, where a user’s data remains on their own device, to algorithms for training models on encrypted data. In this talk, I’ll tour the landscape of these tools and review what works, what doesn’t work, and where they fit in a machine learning pipeline.

Data privacy is a huge concern for everyone in tech these days, thanks to both legislation such as the GDPR, and user opinions driven by scandals in the media. Machine learning is at the forefront of this because it’s hungry for large amounts of training data, but it’s also an area where there’s lots of research on developing solutions that protect user privacy.

When I started learning about privacy-preserving machine learning, I found a bewildering number of research papers, introducing some really cool solutions, but very little practical advice on how to apply them in a real-world situation. This is the talk I wish I could have attended at the start of my learning journey! I’ll review the landscape of Python solutions for privacy-preserving ML and show how they fit into a machine learning pipeline. I’ll explain the tradeoffs of each method and also talk a little about the ethics of using personal data for training ML models. Tools and packages covered will include TensorFlow Privacy, TensorFlow Encrypted and PySyft.

High Energy Physics is the study of the most fundamental constituents of matter and how these elementary particles interact. Often synonymous to Particle Physics, High Energy Physics seeks to find the secrets of the Universe, one of the recent major discoveries being that of the Higgs Boson that confirmed the Standard Model that dictates how all the forces in the Universe interact with each other. High Energy Physics is probably the physics sub-field that has adopted Python most rapidly, only second to Astrophysics.

The talk starts with a look at how computing has looked like in the field of High Energy Physics in the past and how a lot of physicists played major roles in the development of Computer Science. It then explores the emergence of Python as the language of choice for several physicists and two of the major libraries that have been vital to the adoption of Python in the High Energy Physics community - cppyy and uproot. These are especially important since they demonstrate the different ways one could approach shifting the High Energy Physics community from C++ to Python successfully. The talk will focus on a review of where and how Python is used in the High Energy Physics community and how it is slated to look like in the future.

High Energy Physics has its own python toolkit, scikit-hep which comes with a set of python libraries for use by physicists. The Scikit-HEP project is a community-driven and community-oriented project with the aim of providing Particle Physics at large with an ecosystem for data analysis in Python. It is also about improving the interoperability between High Energy Physics tools and the scientific ecosystem in Python.

This year is ideal for this particular talk, being the year when according to some available data, Python usage trumps C++ usage in several High Energy Physics experiments at CERN - as some physicists have dubbed it, this is the year of Python in High Energy Physics.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jClVsR6XfdI/maxresdefault.webp,0,False,False,public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jClVsR6XfdI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jClVsR6XfdI

if statements are elements of a programming language that allow us to control what statements are executed. By chaining together a series of if statements, we can solve any problem we can think of. But code with too many if statements is hard to read and even harder to change. Workarounds that once allowed us to move fast, now get in the way when we go in to make modifications. It doesn’t have to be this way!

This talk demonstrates HOWTO handle complex conditional logic with simple Python classes. The material will be presented in the context of a code refactor for an open-source project: we examine the initial solution featuring duplicate if statements, show how hard it is to make a change, and walk through the process of refactoring if blocks into polymorphic classes. The case study has been simplified to illustrate concepts you can apply to your own code.

After this talk, you will be able to identify situations where an object-oriented solution can be used to improve software design. You will also be exposed to tradeoffs we need to think about before refactoring to higher-level abstractions.

Natural language is constantly evolving. With social media having its own language and interactions becoming more global, NLP models need more than just monolingual corpora to understand and make sense of all this data. Roughly, 50% of the world speaks two or more languages. This comes as a challenge to NL systems because conventional models are trained to understand one language or only translate from one to the other. In this talk, we’ll focus on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) for small multilingual texts.

A key step in building NLU systems is language identification. First, we’ll give an introduction to existing frameworks for this task in Python like cld3, langid, langdetect and will also have a short discussion on their shortcomings.

Another area of concern is transliterated and code-switched text, which consists a combination of two or more structurally different grammars and vocabulary. This type of data can be clearly seen in Tweets and comments on Facebook as well as product reviews. What makes this problem very challenging is the lack of annotated datasets and the added noise of having no “correct” grammar and spelling. We discuss the approaches to solve this using web crawlers and self-generated datasets.

The next section of this talk will be on using the multilingual BERT model released by Google, which is trained in 104 languages. We’ll see some examples of how this model performs when given text pieces in different languages. In the final section, we’ll discuss how to evaluate the model for different tasks.

Biometric scanners, such as face recognition technology, have seen widespread adoption in applications, such as identifying suspected criminals, analyzing candidate’s facial expressions during job interviews, and monitoring attendance at schools.

As these technologies have become more pervasive, many organizations have raised potential concerns about the way these technologies schematize faces. Studies have shown commercial face recognition software has noticeably lower accuracy on darker-skinned individuals, and automatic gender recognition systems regularly misgender trans and non-binary individuals.

In addition, many scholars have written about the rise of techno-surveillance and looming threat of constant government tracking of citizens. In this talk, I will discuss these issues, and what we as technologists do to prevent building software that enables harm upon vulnerable populations.

Images are an important class of data in science or business. Tasks such as quantification of organ geometry in medical imaging, or construction of training sets and pipelines for machine learning models, typically rely on a combination of interactive user annotations and image processing algorithms. In this talk I will present several open-source Python packages for interactive image processing, and how to combine them for advanced applications.

Dash is an open-source framework for building interactive analytical web applications in pure Python (or R). It comes with a set of interactive components which are the bricks from which to build easily custom analytical applications, such as figures using the plotly visualization library, interactive data tables, dropdowns, sliders, etc. These components interact together thanks to callbacks fired when a component is modified. After a demo of how to build an application with Dash, I will show how to interact with image data within Dash for exploring image characteristics or annotating images with various kinds of shapes (from rectangular bounding-box selection to freehand-brush painting of objects).

In addition, Dash applications can make use of Python data-science packages in order to use advanced algorithms to process user-provided annotations. I will focus mostly on scikit-image, and briefly mention machine learning / deep learning tools as well. scikit-image is a popular library for processing 2D and 3D images as Numpy numerical arrays, with a focus on scientific imaging and pedagogical example-based documentation. I will show how to use scikit-image for various image processing tasks, from basic preprocessing (e.g. normalizing image geometry or exposure) to advanced object segmentation tasks. I will finally show how combining scikit-image and Dash can result in advanced image processing applications, which can be written quickly thanks to simple APIs and thorough documentation.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/fnNUMKH6TWI/maxresdefault.webp,0,False,False,public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnNUMKH6TWI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnNUMKH6TWI

As data structures of a project increases in size and complexity, it becomes harder and harder to preserve test completeness. Testing objects with dozens of attributes and arrays with hundreds of values could turn into a laborious task. Often, programmers let these kind of data partially tested, especially if the required code coverage was already achieved.

In this talk we’ll show how to increase test completeness for data structures by applying data regression testing. We’ll be presenting pytest-regressions, a pytest plugin that helps to test datasets and objects by automatically serializing expected data on disk and later checking test results against it. We’ll also show how pytest-regressions make it easier to inspect test data and debug failing tests. The talk will demonstrate examples of data regression being applied to numerical algorithms, web APIs, Flask views and SQLAlchemy models.

When anyone starts on a new team, there’s a ramp-up period where a ton of knowledge is transferred: there are new processes, names, tools, frameworks, and so many other different details to remember. Meanwhile, critical new relationships are started, and lasting impressions are formed. New team members that don’t get to follow a defined process during this time are at risk of not receiving all the information they need to be effective fast, and of not feeling valued by their team.

As an engineer that loves a good repeatable process, I decided that I’d like to make onboarding engineers a task that is both effective and scalable. If you’re bringing on one new engineer or fifty to your project, having a formalized process in place ensures that they can get up to speed on your project quickly, and receive a fair start on the team.

Docker has become a standard tool for developers around the world to deploy applications in a reproducible and robust manner. The existence of Docker and Docker compose have reduced the time needed to set up new software and implementing complex technology stacks for our applications.
Now, six years after the initial release of Docker, we can say with confidence that containers and containers orchestration have become some of the defaults in the current technology stacks.

There are thousands of tutorials and getting started documents for those wanting to adopt Docker for apps deployment. However, if you are a Data Scientist, a researcher or someone working on scientific computing wanting to adopt Docker, the story is quite different. There are very few tutorials (in comparison to app/web) and documents focused on Docker best practices focusing on DS and scientific computing. If you are working on DS, ML or scientific computing, this talk is for you. We’ll cover best practices when building Docker containers for data-intensive applications, from optimising your image build, to ensuring your containers are secure and efficient deployment workflows.

Attendees will leave the talk feeling confident about adopting Docker across a range of DS, ML and research projects.

With video game competitions (also known as eSports) being broadcast on online streams and regular TV stations, in-game video producers have to balance between making the game accessible to casual viewers, and packing enough action on screen to keep regular players interested.

What they choose to show on screen also define the narratives surrounding the competing teams, building hype around them and setting implicit expectations (for example what character class is shown the most).

Nowadays, we are surrounded by devices that can listen to us: Alexa, Siri, Cortana, etc, and the interaction with them has become easier and easier, and more intuitive. The first challenge to communicate in a colloquial way with all these devices is to convert the voice signal to text. To do this, several approaches based on searching methods, algorithmic techniques, and machine learning are combined in very smart and interesting ways.

In this talk, I will introduce the underneath speech recognition systems that these devices utilize. This will be illustrated with a guided example where we will develop a system to recognize isolated words in Python.

Finally, I will show how we are implementing these and more advanced techniques in our production systems, providing transcriptions for different companies and institutions, using Python in different parts of the process.

Nowadays Python is synonymous of data, but not necessarily the best choice for some data tasks. For example, exchange data between different ecosystems is one of the challenges for Python. Pandas and NumPy are very efficient and de facto tools to deal with a reasonable amount of data with performance, but they are limited outside of the Python ecosystem. Acquire and exchange data might be painful due to the problem to write slow conversion code or generated unnecessary large files to talk with other ecosystems, likes large CSV files. Apache Arrow playing with Pandas is a great option as technologies that handle these problems with an excellent performance playing natively with Python.

When supporting a data science team, data engineers are tasked with building a platform that keeps a wide range of stakeholders happy. Data scientists want rapid iteration, infrastructure engineers want monitoring and security controls, and product owners want their solutions deployed in time for quarterly reports. Collaboration between these stakeholders can be difficult, as every data science pipeline has a unique set of constraints and system requirements (compute resources, network connectivity, etc). For these reasons, data engineers strive to give their data scientists as much flexibility as possible, while maintaining an observable and resilient infrastructure.

In recent years, Apache Airflow (a Python-based task orchestrator developed at Airbnb) has gained popularity as a collaborative platform between data-centric Pythonistas, and infrastructure engineers looking to spare their users from verbose and rigid yaml files. Apache Airflow exposes a flexible pythonic interface that can be used as a collaboration point between data engineers and data scientists. Data engineers can build custom operators that abstract details of the underlying system and data scientists can use those operators (and many more) to build a diverse range of data pipelines.

For this 30 minute talk, we will take an idea from a single-machine Jupyter Notebook to a cross-service Spark + Tensorflow pipeline, to a canary tested, hyper-parameter-tuned, production-ready model served on Google Cloud Functions.

This talk discusses the challenges and options to scale Python with Dask on distributed hardware. We particularly focus on how Dask gets deployed on cluster resource managers like Kubernetes, Yarn, and the cloud today.

The Python data science stack (Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn and others) has become the gold standard in most data centric fields due to a combination of intuitive high level APIs and efficient low-level code. However, these libraries were not originally designed to scale beyond a single CPU or data that fits in memory. Over the last few years the Dask library has worked with these libraries to provide scalable variants, which do run on multi-core workstations or on distributed clusters. This has allowed advanced users the ability to scale Python to handle 100+TB datasets.

However, deploying Dask within an institution remains a challenge. How do we balance load across many machines? How do we share with other distributed systems running on those same machines? How do we control access and provide authentication and security? As more institutions adopt Python to handle scalable computation these questions arise with greater urgency. This talk discusses the options today to deploy Dask securly within an institution on distributed hardware, and dives into some examples where this has had a large positive social impact.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/deX0GlW4uew/maxresdefault.webp,0,False,False,public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deX0GlW4uew,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deX0GlW4uew

The derivative is a concept from calculus which gives you the rate of change of a function: for a small change in an input, how much does the output change? This idea turns out to be very important in natural sciences, and is used in many optimization algorithms, which find the maximum or minimum of functions.

Automatic differentiation is a technique for computing the derivative of a function. Python has a number of libraries implementing automatic differentiation, many of which are put to use for deep learning, but can be used on their own.

In this talk I will give intuition for the derivative and its high dimensional sibling, the gradient. We will take a tour of applications, including optimization and computational art, with examples using jax, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.

You know how to program in Python. Now learn how to apply that skill to building distributed serverless applications in the cloud. You won’t write just one program, you’ll create several and connect them through a shared database, network requests, message queues, or triggering events. This is a hands-on workshop–bring your own PC and leave having built and deployed a significant cloud application. You’ll see not only how to use different cloud services to run your code, but why you would choose each one for an application’s specific needs.

In this video, you will learn Postgres superpowers to help optimize performance of Python and Django apps, using a sample Django application which runs on Azure Database for PostgreSQL.
 
This talk walks through how to tackle the most common pain point: slow queries. You’ll dive into the Django ORM to identify performance bottlenecks, and we’ll analyze both Python and SQL code. We’ll explore the usefulness of pg_stat_statements, django-debug-toolbar, Postgres logs, keyset pagination—as well as Query Performance Insight and Performance Recommendations on Azure. You’ll learn how to eradicate loops in your code (this is important); how to limit what you select; and how to scale out Postgres horizontally using Hyperscale (Citus) on Azure Database for PostgreSQL, in a way that is transparent to your app and does not require any re-architecture.
 
Just like chocolate and peanut butter go better together, so do Python and Postgres. These Postgres optimization techniques (what I call “superpowers”) will empower you to improve the performance of your Python and Django apps.

CrypTen is a machine learning framework built on PyTorch that enables you to easily study and develop machine learning models using secure computing techniques. CrypTen allows you to develop models with the PyTorch API while performing computations on encrypted data – without revealing the protected information. Different parties can contribute information to the model or measurement without revealing what they contributed.

In this workshop, we will teach participants how to use CrypTen using interactive notebooks - participants should bring a laptop with Jupyter notebook installed. We will work through four common use scenarios for privacy preserving machine learning using secure multiparty computation to allow learning without sharing data:
- Feature Aggregation: multiple parties hold distinct sets of features, and want to perform computations over the joint feature set.
- Data Labeling: one party holds feature data while another party holds corresponding labels, and they would like to learn a relationship between the features and labels.
- Dataset Augmentation: several parties each hold a small number of observations, and would like to use all the observations in order to improve the statistical power of a measurement or model.
- Model Hiding: one party has access to a trained model, while another party would like to apply that model to its own data.

What we’ll cover:
- Installation / Setup (20 min)
- Machine Learning and CrypTen (10 min)
- Secure Multiparty Compute and Tensors in CrypTen (15 min)
- Training a Machine Learning Model on Encrypted Data (45 min)

Since PEP 484 in 2014, type hints and the mypy tool have become an important part of the Python ecosystem. Type hints provide an incremental way to add information to the Python source, which can be checked by external tools like mypy and some IDE environments like PyCharm. Type hint checking can be part of a CI/CD pipeline to provide confidence that the code is likely to behave properly at run-time. Python’s Duck-Typing approach can lead to working code that is hard to describe with available type hints.

This tutorial expects hands-on participation with a large number of small examples. It will start with some simple cases of type hints. We’ll look at complex data structures and ways to factor the complexity out of the type hints. We’ll look at circular type references, common on problems where graphs are represented. The techniques for “debugging” type hints will focus on exposing the mypy reasons about the source code.

We’ll look at two very easy and useful ways to incorporate type hints into class definitions using the typing.NamedTuple class and the @dataclass decorator. We’ll also look at situations where the type: ignore comment can be appropriate. Another important topic will touch on how we can write a stub for a library where the code doesn’t have type hints.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/udVRTBm_-q0/maxresdefault.webp,0,False,False,public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udVRTBm_-q0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udVRTBm_-q0

Imagine if we could combine the beneﬁts of Raspberry PI microprocessors, Arduino microcontrollers and the programmable logic of a ﬁeld programmable gate array (FPGA) in a single development platform? What if we could connect all of these components together with high speed interconnect and add lots of programmable, high-speed IO? That would be quite the embedded development dream machine! Things would be even more exciting if we could integrate all of the parts into a single programmable system-on-chip.

But wait … hardware, without good software, is just scrap metal! We need to program the machine with a user-friendly programming language with hundreds of thousands of libraries, so that we would not have to re-write code for problems that we know have already been solved. And since this is a wish-list for our dream machine, we should make sure to include libraries for machine learning and data science because these are some of the hottest areas that we want to explore.

This workshop will introduce PYNQ, based on Xilinx programmable System-on-Chips. PYNQ serves up a browser-based, integrated development environment (IDE) for Python, so that new users can experience the power of Xilinx platforms without having to install new software, or create their own FPGA hardware designs. Meanwhile, PYNQ makes experienced developers more productive and helps them to create, document, and distribute their designs, more eﬀectively.

As data volumes and computational complexity of data analysis techniques have increased, so has the need for acceleration of these workloads to allow the data scientist to quickly iterate on models. One of the key ways to achieve this has been through GPU acceleration. Traditionally, GPU acceleration has required specialized knowledge of low-level C++ GPGPU programming. However, the open-source RAPIDS data science libraries allow data scientists to easily make use of GPU acceleration in common ETL, machine learning, and graph analytics workloads using familiar Python APIs (e.g. pandas and scikit-learn).

This workshop will introduce RAPIDS, walk through its component libraries, and will show participants how these libraries allow them to easily introduce GPU acceleration into their workflows to speed up compute times and increase iteration on their models. We will demonstrate common data ETL (cuDF), machine learning (cuML), graph analytics (cuGraph), signal processing (cuSignal), spatial analytics (cuSpatial), and InfoSec (cyber log accelerator) workloads that RAPIDS accelerates. We will also discuss how users can integrate RAPIDS and the broader open-source GPU data science ecosystem to solve their specific use cases.

An understanding of basic data science concepts will be helpful, but is not required.

This is a tutorial that I wish someone gave to me when I first learned Python.

Python is (relatively) easy and fun to learn, but there is a gap between “knowing how to write Python code” and “knowing the tools and good practices when writing Python code”. This tutorial will try to bridge this gap. It’s intended for beginners who know Python, but who are not sure how to write a Python project from scratch.

In this tutorial you will learn:

How to set up VS Code for writing Python
How to use virtualenv, pyenv, pipenv, and pipx
How to use cookiecutter, how to structure your Python project, and how to easily deploy it with Docker
What’s PEP8 and how to enforce it with code linters/formatters (black)
Why you should use IPython instead of Python REPL
How to test your code with pytest
How to create great documentation with Sphinx
To follow all parts of the tutorial you need to have: VS Code, Docker, and a modern version of Python (at least 3.4, preferably 3.6 or newer) installed on your computer.

From picking the right plot for the particular type of data, statistic, or result; to pre-processing sophisticated datasets, and even making important decisions about the aesthetic of a figure, visualization is both a science and art that requires both knowledge and practice to master.

This tutorial is for python users who are familiar with python and basic plotting, and want to build strong visualization skills that will let them effectively communicate any data, statistic, or result.

We will use python libraries such as seaborn, matplotlib, plotly, and sklearn; and discuss topics such as density estimation, dimensionality reduction, exploring similar datasets, interactive plotting, and making suitable choices for communication. Drawing examples from datasets in the scientific, financial, geospatial (mapping) fields and more.

In the past year, massive developments have been made in the natural language processing field. Improvements in areas such as question answering, machine translation, and sentiment analysis have opened up doors to utilize NLP more effectively than ever before.

In this tutorial we will perform a brief overview of the field of NLP and look at the Python libraries that allow us to utilize different techniques and models. We will start with simple, traditional approaches to NLP that will provide us baseline for our models. As we progress in the tutorial we will look at some more advanced concepts that can give quick boosts to model performance. We will end by introducing state-of-the-art language models and how we can incorporate them into applications that we build.

In this tutorial, we’ll go through several activities for building a GitHub App that can be easily installed in various repositories.

Your GitHub bot can:
- thank the maintainer for installing the bot
- thank first time contributors for making a pull request to your repository

Learn about GitHub APIs, GitHub Apps, and authentications through these fun activities! We’ll be using Python libraries like gidgethub, aiohttp, and asyncio. F-strings included!

In this tutorial you will analyze openly available data and apply a GIS-lens to it! We’ll use data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) to recreate the map above! We’ll use Integrated Post-secondary Education Data System (IPEDS) data to map out all the higher education institutions in the United States and analyze the results. We’ll look at the equity implications of Education Deserts and learn some really neat pandas and geopandas tricks in the process!

This tutorial is perfect for novice data analysts, pythonistas, social scientists, and journalists that want to learn about the powerful pandas and geopandas libraries and how to use it to analyze openly available data (and for those who’ve been using them but could learn a trick or two to make their workflow even more effective, reproducible and open). Some familiarity with jupyter and pandas is appreciated but not necessary.

This is the ultimate concurrency tutorial. Aimed for beginners, we won’t skip the ugly parts (OS low level and computer science concepts). In this tutorial you’ll learn:

what is concurrency and why you need it?
what’s the role of the OS in computing and parallelism?
how processes work, what fundamental OS structures are used
what are threads, how are they created and what’s their scope
what modules does Python offer for multithreading (_thread, threading, concurrent.futures) and what’s the difference between them, the same for multiprocessing (subprocess, multiprocessing or concurrent.futures).
what are race conditions? how to avoid them with synchronization primitives and threadsafe collections
What is the GIL? In which situations will it affect our code?
This tutorial will include coding examples for all the concepts in it, along with two main activities, in which we’ll be writing a web server both using multithreading and multiprocessing!

At the end of this tutorial, you’ll feel confident answering the following questions:

Should I even use concurrency?
If I want to use concurrency, threads or processes?
How can I make sure my code is safe?

Python 2 reached end of life (EOL). However, there are still many projects that
use Python 2. Staying with Python 2 is certainly no long-term option for most
projects.

Porting a larger program to Python 3 brakes backward compatibility with
Python 2. One solution for this problem is the single-source approach that
results in source code that runs with Python 2 and 3 without any changes.

This tutorial provides a short overview over the most important differences
between Python 2 and 3. After looking at different approaches for Python 3
support, the focus will be on writing single-source programs with
python-future. You will learn how to port to Python 3 without loosing Python 2
support. Finally dropping Python 2 support will get as simple as removing a few
imports.

The content of this tutorial is inspired by questions I received from
participants in trainings about how to smoothly transition from Python 2 to
Python 3. Making Python 2 working as much as possible as Python 3 seems the best
option to me. You are encouraged to bring your questions about this topic.

I teach about this topic on a regular basis in my trainings. Being a full-time
profession trainer, I have plenty opportunity to get involved with many
programmers who have to deal with this problem.

Software Requirements
You will need Python 3.8 installed on your laptop. Python 3.6/3.7 should also
work. You also need Python 2.7 installed to test if the code runs with Python 2
and Python 3. You may use Python 3.9 if is released at the time of the tutorial
and all dependencies can be installed.

JupyterLab
I will use a JupyterLab for the tutorial because it makes a very good
teaching tool. You are welcome to use the setup you prefer, i.e editor, IDE,
REPL. If you also like to use a JupyterLab, I recommend conda for
easy installation. Similarly to virtualenv, conda allows creating isolated
environments but allows binary installs for all platforms.

There are two ways to install Jupyter via conda:

Use Minconda. This is a small install and (after you installed it)
you can use the command conda to create an environment:
conda create -n pycon2020py38 python=3.8
Now you can change into this environment:
conda activate pycon2020py38. The prompt should change to (pycon2020py38).
Now you can install JupyterLab: conda install jupyterlab.

Do the same with Python 2.7, i.e. conda create -n pycon2020py27 python=2.7
and activate accordingly conda activate pycon2020py27.

Install the dependencies:

Jupyter Lab 2 ‘conda install jupyterlab’
six ‘conda install six’
python-future ‘conda install future’
Hint: You do all this in one command:
conda create -n pycon2020py38 python=3.8 six jupyterlab future
and
conda create -n pycon2020py27 python=2.7 six jupyterlab future

You can create a comparable setup with virtual environments and pip, if you
prefer.

Working with conda environments
After creating a new environment, the system might still work with some
stale settings. Even when the command which tells you that you are using an
executable from your environment, this might actually not be the case.
If you see strange behavior using a command line tool in your environment,
use hash -r and try again.

Python supports functions as first-class objects. This means that functions can be assigned to variables, and passed to and from other functions, just like any other object in Python.

One powerful application of this is the decorator syntax, which makes it easy to apply one function to another at compile time. Decorators offer a simple and readable way of adding capabilities to your code. This tutorial will teach you how decorators work, and how to create your own decorators.

Being comfortable with using and creating decorators, will make you a more efficient Python programmer. You will learn how a single line sometimes can transform your code: add authentication to your website, write a class for you, or even JIT-compile your long-running calculations.

As Python grows as a language, both in popularity and complexity, so too must training for existing users. While this area does fall under education, one-off short form training and professional development have unique needs, questions, and expertise. Being related to education, but not always identifying primarily as educators, many trainers are isolated from the broader community of expertise on teaching and learning. Many operate as independent freelancers, so they may lack a network of colleagues to connect with and learn from. This means that they are missing out on key discoveries and practices from the traditional education community, and the educator community is missing out on the expertise of teaching adult professional learners.

Classic testing tutorials usually present code that’s free of side-effects and external I/O dependencies, but the real world is seldom so straightforward. We find ourselves reaching for mocks to keep our tests isolated, and that often leads to tests that are hard to understand and maintain, and we start to question their value.

When we substitute integration or end-to-end tests to assure ourselves that things work in the real world, we end up with test suites getting slower and slower, and instead of a “test pyramid” we end up with an “ice cream cone”.

This talk proposes a cure: if we stop ourselves from using mocks, cold turkey, we will be forced to think more carefully about how to design our code, how to separate business logic from integration and I/O concerns. The talk will cover patterns like “Functional Core, Imperative Shell”, the use of Dependency Injection and hand-rolled fakes as an alternative to mocking and patching, and show how they can help us get better-designed code, more maintainable tests, and a healthy test pyramid.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/rk-f3B-eMkI/maxresdefault.webp,0,False,False,public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rk-f3B-eMkI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rk-f3B-eMkI
