By using a single file Django project, developers can create asynchronous microservices with ease. The concept of lightweight Django projects has been around for a while, initially appearing in the book \"Lightweight Django\" in 2014. However, it wasn't until Django introduced ASGI in 2022 that it became viable for microservices.\n\nDanilov discussed the benefits of Django microservices, such as the all-in-one package, standard architecture, and rapid development speed. He also highlighted challenges faced, including misconceptions about Django's suitability for microservices, issues with settings.py, and concerns about URL routing and performance.\n\nThe talk aimed to educate the audience about uDjango, a technology for building synchronous and asynchronous microservices using one or two files. Drawing inspiration from various industry experts and projects, Danilov emphasized the simplicity and efficiency of using uDjango for high-performance microservices.\n\n⭐️ About PyCon DE & PyData Berlin:\nThe PyCon DE & PyData conference unite the Python, AI, and data science communities, offering a unique platform for collaboration and innovation.

The collective, which focuses on sonic exploration and live performance, dived into the challenges faced in developing an interactive realtime audio processing system for live music performances. They found that the use of callbacks, although commonly employed in programming, became burdensome in this context.\n\nAmiguet detailed how they streamlined their system by implementing a thin abstraction layer, replacing complex callback structures with more readable generators. By utilizing generators, which yield results instead of the traditional return method, they were able to enhance the efficiency and clarity of their code significantly.\n\nAt Les Chemins de Traverse, they blend different musical styles and techniques, creating a unique sonic experience. By leveraging tools like Olivier Bélanger's pyo module for realtime audio processing, they aim to augment traditional acoustical instruments with computer-generated sounds, adding a new dimension to live music performances.\n\nThrough their experience, Amiguet showcased how a thoughtful abstraction layer can simplify code, enabling a more focused approach to music production rather than getting entangled in technical complexities. While their case study is music-specific, the principles they applied can be adapted to various scenarios where callbacks lead to convoluted and cumbersome code structures.\n\n⭐️ About PyCon DE & PyData Berlin:\nThe PyCon DE & PyData conference unite the Python, AI, and data science communities, offering a unique platform for collaboration and innovation.
